Objects made of gold or silver are unaffected by the elemental’s Pulse. \n* Pull. Each creature that is wearing metal armor or holding a metal weapon within 5 feet of the magnetic elemental must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or the metal items worn or carried by it stick to the magnetic elemental. A creature that is made of metal or is wearing metal armor and that fails the saving throw is stuck to the elemental and grappled (escape DC 15). If the item is a weapon and the wielder can’t or won’t let go of the weapon, the wielder is stuck to the elemental and grappled (escape DC 15). A stuck object can’t be used. Grappled and stuck creatures and objects move with the elemental when it moves. A creature can take its action to remove one creature or object from the elemental by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The magnetic elemental’s Armor Class increases by 1 for each creature grappled in this way. \n* Push. Each creature that is wearing metal armor or holding a metal weapon within 10 feet of the elemental must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) force damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the elemental. On a success, a target takes half the damage and isn’t pushed. A creature grappled by the elemental has disadvantage on this saving throw."}],"reactions":"","legendary_desc":"","legendary_actions":"","special_abilities":[{"name":"Controlled Polarity","desc":"The magnetic elemental has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if the creature is wearing metal armor.
