Each creature in the area when the quickserpent creates the pit must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink 1d4 feet into the quicksand and become restrained. A creature that successfully saves moves to the pit’s edge as it is formed. A creature that enters the quicksand for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in the quicksand it sinks 1d4 feet and is restrained. A creature that is completely submerged in quicksand can’t breathe.\n\nA restrained creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the edge of the quicksand. A creature within 5 feet of the quicksand can take an action to pull a creature out of the quicksand. Doing so requires a successful DC 15 Strength check, and the quickserpent has advantage on attack rolls against the creature until the end of the creature’s next turn."}],"reactions":"","legendary_desc":"","legendary_actions":"","special_abilities":[{"name":"Swamp Camouflage","desc":"The quickserpent has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in swampy terrain."}],"spell_list":[],"page_no":303,"img_main":null,"document__slug":"tob2","document__title":"Tome of Beasts 2 OGL","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal"}
