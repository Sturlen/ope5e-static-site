This flesh isn’t under the deep troll’s control, but it views the troll as an ally. The oozing flesh acts on the deep troll’s initiative and has its own action and movement. It has an AC of 10, 10 hp, and a walking speed of 15 feet. It can make one attack with a +6 to hit, and it deals 7 (2d6) acid damage on a hit. If not destroyed, the oozing flesh lives for 1 week, voraciously consuming any non-deep troll creature it encounters. After that time, it dissolves into a puddle of water and gore."},{"name":"Regeneration","desc":"The deep troll regains 10 hp at the start of its turn.
