For example, it can create a rope from absorbed hemp, clothing from absorbed flax or wool, and a longsword from absorbed metal. A fabricator can create intricate objects like thieves’ tools and objects with moving parts with at least 1 hour of work and twice the requisite raw materials, but it can’t create magic items.

Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or once-living material (such as bone or wood) that hits the fabricator is slowly dismantled by the minute constructs that make up the fabricator. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or once-living material that hits the fabricator is destroyed after dealing damage.
