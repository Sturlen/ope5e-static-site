Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the bloodsapper attaches to the target. While attached, the bloodsapper doesn’t attack. Instead, at the start of each of the bloodsapper’s turns, the target loses 12 (2d8 + 3) hp due to blood loss. The bloodsapper can detach itself from a target by spending 5 feet of its movement, which it does once it has drained 25 hp from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the bloodsapper’s tongue by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check. Alternatively, the bloodsapper’s tongue can be attacked and severed (AC 12; hp 20). The bloodsapper regrows a severed tongue when it completes a long rest or when it reduces a creature to 0 hp.","attack_bonus":5,"damage_dice":"2d8+3"},{"name":"Bloody Breath (Recharge Special)","desc":"The bloodsapper can expel a 15-foot cone of acrid gas and blood from its bladder. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) acid damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a bloodsapper uses its Bloody Breath, it can’t use Bloody Breath again until it has drained at least 25 hp of blood from a creature."}],"reactions":"","legendary_desc":"","legendary_actions":"","special_abilities":[{"name":"Blood Scent","desc":"A bloodsapper can smell blood within 240 feet of it.
