Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. Creatures immune to the poisoned condition are immune to this disease. The diseased creature’s lungs fill with the spores, which kill the creature in a number of days equal to 1d10 + the creature’s Constitution score, unless the disease is removed. One hour after infection, the creature becomes poisoned for the rest of the duration. After the creature dies, it rises as a crimson shambler, roaming for 1 week and attempting to infect any other creatures it encounters. At the end of the week, it collapses, its body fertilizing a new patch of crimson slime. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the spores of all crimson shamblers and crimson slime for the next 24 hours."}],"spell_list":[],"page_no":73,"img_main":null,"document__slug":"tob2","document__title":"Tome of Beasts 2 OGL","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal"}
