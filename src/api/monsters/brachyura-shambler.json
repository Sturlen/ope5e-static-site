The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hp from spending Hit Dice and no hp from finishing a long rest. At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character’s exhaustion level decreases by 1 level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.","attack_bonus":3,"damage_dice":"2d4+2"}],"reactions":"","legendary_desc":"","legendary_actions":"","special_abilities":[{"name":"Puncturing Claws","desc":"A creature that starts its turn grappled by the brachyura shambler must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 7 (2d6) piercing damage."}],"spell_list":[],"page_no":49,"img_main":null,"document__slug":"tob2","document__title":"Tome of Beasts 2 OGL","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal"}
