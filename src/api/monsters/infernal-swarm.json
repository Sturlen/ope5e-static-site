A creature within 10 feet of the swarm immediately discerns the truth.\n\nWhile in fiend form, it can wield weapons and hold, grasp, push, pull, or interact with objects that might otherwise require a more humanoid form to accomplish. If the infernal swarm takes thunder damage while in its fiend form, it immediately changes to its shapeless form.\n\nWhile in shapeless form, it can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa and can move through any opening large enough for a Small fiend, but it can’t grapple or be grappled."}],"spell_list":[],"page_no":215,"img_main":null,"document__slug":"tob2","document__title":"Tome of Beasts 2 OGL","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal"}
