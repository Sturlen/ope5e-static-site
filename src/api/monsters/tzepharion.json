If it hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or its soul is forced out of its body, appearing 20 feet in a random direction away from its body, for 1 minute. The creature has control of its soul, which is invisible and can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but it can’t cast spells or take any actions. The creature’s body is knocked unconscious and can’t be awoken until its soul returns, but it can take damage as normal. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, reoccupying its body on a success. Alternatively, a creature can reoccupy its body early if it starts its turn within 5 feet of its body. If a creature doesn’t return to its body within 1 minute, the creature dies. If its body is reduced to 0 hp before the creature reoccupies its body, the creature dies."}],"reactions":"","legendary_desc":"","legendary_actions":"","special_abilities":[{"name":"Devil’s Sight","desc":"Magical darkness doesn’t impede the tzepharion’s darkvision."},{"name":"Eye of Rage","desc":"As a bonus action, the tzepharion incites rage in up to three beasts or monstrosities it can see within 60 feet of it.
