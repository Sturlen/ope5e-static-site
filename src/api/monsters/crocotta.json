If it looks at the crocotta in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.\n\nCanines are immune to the crocotta’s Paralyzing Gaze, and canine-like humanoids, such as werewolves, have advantage on the saving throw."},{"name":"Pounce","desc":"If the crocotta moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
