As an action, you can break the pearl, destroying it, and conjure a Blood Elemental (see Creature Codex) for 1 hour. The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.",
