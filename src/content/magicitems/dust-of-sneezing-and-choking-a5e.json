{"slug":"dust-of-sneezing-and-choking-a5e","name":"Dust of Sneezing and Choking","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"This fine gray dust is usually found in a vial and appears to be _dust of disappearance_ , even when magic is used to _identify_ it. Each vial contains enough for a single use.\n\nYou can use an action to throw the dust into the air. You and creatures within 30 feet of you that breathe make a DC 15 Constitution _saving throw_  or become wracked with violent coughing and sneezing, becoming _incapacitated_  and beginning to _suffocate_ . While conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects on a success. A _lesser restoration_  spell also ends the effects.","rarity":"Uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
