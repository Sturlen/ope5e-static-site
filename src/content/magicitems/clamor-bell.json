{"slug":"clamor-bell","name":"Clamor Bell","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"You can affix this small, brass bell to an object with the leather cords tied to its top. If anyone other than you picks up, interacts with, or uses the object without first speaking the bell's command word, it rings for 5 minutes or until you touch it and speak the command word again. The ringing is audible 100 feet away. If a creature takes an action to cut the bindings holding the bell onto the object, the bell ceases ringing 1 round after being released from the object.","rarity":"common","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
