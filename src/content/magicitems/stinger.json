When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can use a bonus action to inject paralyzing venom in the target. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures immune to poison are also immune to this dagger's paralyzing venom. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.",
