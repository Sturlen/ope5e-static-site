After studying this book for 1 hour each day over the course of a year and a day, you gain permanent influence over one randomly determined humanoid on your plane, even if it is immune to being _charmed_ . This otherwise functions as the _suggestion_ spell (no _saving throw_ ). The target uses the statistics of a _cambion_ , but maintains its prior physical appearance. A __wish_ spell, or the destruction of the book via __disintegrate_  or similar magic, frees the creature from this effect.","rarity":"Legendary","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
