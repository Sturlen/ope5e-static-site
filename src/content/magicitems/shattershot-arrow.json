{"slug":"shattershot-arrow","name":"Shattershot Arrow","type":"Weapon (arrow)","desc":"When you hit a creature with this weapon, the target takes an extra 3d6 thunder damage as the arrow releases a sudden, loud ringing. Each creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal that is within 10 feet of the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s within 10 feet of the target.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"toh","document__title":"Tome of Heroes","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"}
