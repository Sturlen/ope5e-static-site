{"slug":"lightning-rod","name":"Lightning Rod","type":"Rod","desc":"This rod is made from the blackened wood of a lightning-struck tree and topped with a spike of twisted iron. It functions as a magic javelin that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you are immune to lightning damage, and each creature within 5 feet of you has resistance to lightning damage. The rod can hold up to 6 charges, but it has 0 charges when you first attune to it. Whenever you are subjected to lightning damage, the rod gains 1 charge. While the rod has 6 charges, you have resistance to lightning damage instead of immunity. The rod loses 1d6 charges daily at dawn.","rarity":"very rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
