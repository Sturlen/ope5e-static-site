You can use an action to read the scroll and sense whether that type of treasure is present within 1 mile of you for 1 hour. This scroll reveals the treasure's general direction, but not its specific location or amount. The GM chooses the type of treasure or determines it by rolling a d100 and consulting the following table. | dice: 1d% | Treasure Type |\n| ----------- | ------------- |\n| 01-10 | Copper |\n| 11-20 | Silver |\n| 21-30 | Electrum |\n| 31-40 | Gold |\n| 41-50 | Platinum |\n| 51-75 | Gemstone |\n| 76-80 | Art objects |\n| 81-00 | Magic items |",
