For 1 hour after drinking this potion, you gain the following benefits:\n* You have blindsight out to a range of 60 feet.\n* When you roll a 1 on an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.\n *You can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.\nWhen the duration ends, you are stunned until the end of your next turn as your mind reels from the loss of the mind-altering effects.",
