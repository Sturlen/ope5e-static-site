While traveling under the parasol, you ignore the drawbacks of traveling in hot weather or a hot environment. Though it protects you from the sun's heat in the desert or geothermal heat in deep caverns, the parasol doesn't protect you from damage caused by super-heated environments or creatures, such as lava or an azer's Heated Body trait, or magic that deals fire damage, such as the fire bolt spell.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
