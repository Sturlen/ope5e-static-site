{"slug":"rhinam-life-gem-a5e","name":"Rhinam Life Gem","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"Able to swallow the life energies of an enemy in their final moments, these gems can then be used to extend the life of its owner and restore their health. Some believe the gods destroyed the Rhinam empire for the creation of these and most people treat them—and beings using them—as anathema.\n\nThe emerald green stones are all alike in appearance and instantly recognisable. Shaped into a palm-sized disc, they are the thickness of a finger and have rounded edges that are smooth to the touch. Etched in gold on both sides is the symbol of the Rhinam royal household: a rampant eagle clutching four spears.\n\nOnce per day you can, as an action, place the gem over the heart of a humanoid that died in the last minute. The gem then consumes the creature’s soul and gains 1 charge. Nothing less than a __wish_  spell or divine intervention can restore the creature’s spirit. Gems can hold a maximum of 10 charges.\n\nAfter spending a minute meditating on the gem, you can spend a charge to regain 4d12 hit points. Alternately, once a week you can spend a minute meditating to keep yourself from aging for the next week. When a charge is spent, roll 1d10\\. If the result is higher than the number of charges remaining, the gem can no longer be recharged and will shatter when its final charge is spent. Life gems are typically discovered with 1d4 charges.\n\n**_Curse._** Destroying a soul is a dark act that comes with many consequences. After using the Rhinam life gem, you may find yourself accosted by celestials and fiends alike, seeking either to destroy the object or obtain it for their own reasons. In addition, the Narrator may rule that using the life gem too many times means you gain the Evil alignment and emit a strong evil aura for the purposes of any feature, spell, or trait that detects or affects Evil creatures.","rarity":"Very Rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
