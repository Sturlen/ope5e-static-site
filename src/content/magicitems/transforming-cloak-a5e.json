    "desc": "While you are attuned to and wearing a _transforming cloak_, you gain _resistance_  to a type of damage and you can use an action to activate an elemental form that lasts for 1 hour, until you fall _unconscious_ , or you use a bonus action to end it. Once you have used the cloak to take on an elemental form, you cannot use that property again until you have finished a long rest. The resistance you gain and the type of your elemental form is listed on Table: Transforming Cloaks.\n\n_**Gnome Cloak.**_ This cloak appears to be made of vibrant earthy soil, yet it leaves no dirt where it touches. You have _advantage_  on _saving throws_  to resist being pushed, pulled, knocked prone, or otherwise involuntarily moved. While your earth form is active you gain _resistance_  to damage from nonmagical weapons, tremorsense to a range of 30 feet, and a burrow speed equal to half your Speed (leaving no tunnel behind). \n\n_**Salamander Cloak.**_ This cloak appears to be made of living flames, though it does not burn. While your fire form is active you gain _immunity to fire_  damage, your weapon attacks deal fire damage, when a creature hits you with a melee weapon attack it takes 1d6 fire damage, you can fit through spaces at least an inch wide without squeezing, and you gain a climb speed equal to your Speed.\n\n_**Sylph Cloak.**_ This cloak looks like iridescent dragonfly wings that appear to flutter when seen out of the corner of the eye. While your air form is active you gain a fly speed of 30 feet (hover), you do not need to breathe, you do not provoke _opportunity attacks_ , and you can pass through spaces at least half an inch wide without squeezing.\n\n**_Undine Cloak._** This fine blue and green cloak always appears to be wet, yet it never drips. While your water form is active you gain _resistance_  to fire damage, a swim speed of 60 feet, the ability to breathe water, and you can pass through space at least half an inch wide without squeezing.\n\n__**Table: Transforming Cloaks**__\n| **Cloak**        | **Elemental Component** | **Resistance** | **Elemental Form** |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |\n| Gnome cloak      | _Giant earth elemental_ | Acid           | Earth form         |\n| Salamander cloak | _Giant fire elemental_  | Fire           | Fire form          |\n| Sylph cloak      | _Giant air elemental_   | Lightning      | Air form           |\n| Undine cloak     | _Giant water elemental_ | Cold           | Water form         |",
