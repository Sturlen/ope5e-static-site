{"slug":"dial-of-dal-a5e","name":"Dial of Dal","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"None living know who or what Dal was, only that the name is carved into this device. About half a foot in diameter, this flat disk resembles a sundial with many styles (time-telling edges), each of which can be moved on its own course, rotating on the flat of the disc on an undetectable groove. As these are moved, you receive a vision of events and emotions that have occurred in your current location.\n\nAs an action, you can use the dial of Dal to cast the __legend lore_  spell focused on your current location without the need for material components. Once used in this way, the dial cannot be used again until you finish a _long rest_ .","rarity":"Very Rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
