{"slug":"bead-of-tracking-a5e","name":"Bead of Tracking","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"This miniature bead is covered with hundreds of small hooks. When you use an action to place it on a creature’s clothing or hide, the bead hangs there imperceptibly and creates a bond between you and the creature. You gain an expertise die on checks made to track the creature while the bead remains on it. To place the bead during combat without being noticed, you must succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against the creature’s maneuver DC (or when outside of combat, the creature’s passive Perception).","rarity":"Uncommon","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
