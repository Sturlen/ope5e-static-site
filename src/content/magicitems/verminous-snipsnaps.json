    "desc": "This stoppered jar holds small animated knives and scissors. The jar weighs 1 pound, and its command word is often written on the jar's label. You can use an action to remove the stopper, which releases the spinning blades into a space you can see within 30 feet of you. The knives and scissors fill a cube 10 feet on each side and whirl in place, flaying creatures and objects that enter the cube. When a creature enters the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 2d12 piercing damage. You can use a bonus action to speak the command word, returning the blades to the jar. Otherwise, the knives and scissors remain in that space indefinitely.",
