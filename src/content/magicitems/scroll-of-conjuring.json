{"slug":"scroll-of-conjuring","name":"Scroll of Conjuring","type":"Scroll","desc":"By using an action to recite the incantation inscribed on this scroll, you can conjure a creature to assist you, chosen by the GM or determined by rolling a d8 and consulting the appropriate table. Once the creature appears, the scroll crumbles to dust and is destroyed. The creature vanishes after 8 hours or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. Alternately, you can command the creature to perform a single task, which it will do to the best of its ability. A task can be simple (“Remove the debris blocking this passage.”) or complex (“Search the castle, taking care to remain unnoticed. Take a count of the guards and their locations, then return here and draw me a map.”) but must be completable within 8 hours. | d8 | Creature | |\n| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |\n| 1 | Dust Mephit\\|Dust/Ice Mephit\\|Ice/Magma Mephit\\|Magma mephit or Lantern Dragonette | ] |\n| 2 | Hippogriff or Clockwork Soldier | |\n| 3 | Imp/Quasit or Aviere | |\n| 4 | Death Dog or Giant Moth - Shockwing | |\n| 5 | Centaur or Roggenwolf | |\n| 6 | Ettercap or Clockwork Hound | |\n| 7 | Ogre of Spider thief | |\n| 8 | Griffon or Dragon - Light - Wyrmling | | | d8 | Creature |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1 | Copper Dragon Wyrmling or Wind Wyrmling Dragon |\n| 2 | Pegasus or Demon - Wind |\n| 3 | Gargoyle or Drake - Hoarfrost |\n| 4 | Grick or Kitsune |\n| 5 | Hell Hound or Kobold - Swolbold |\n| 6 | Winter Wolf or Clockwork Huntsman |\n| 7 | Minotaur or Drake - Peluda |\n| 8 | Doppelganger or Pombero | | d8 | Creature |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| 1 | Bearded Devil or Korrigan |\n| 2 | Nightmare or Wyrmling Flame Dragon |\n| 3 | Phase Spider or Bloodsapper |\n| 4 | Chuul or Elemental - Venom |\n| 5 | Ettin or Domovoi |\n| 6 | Succubus or Incubus or Ratatosk |\n| 7 | Salamander or Drake - Moon |\n| 8 | Xorn or Karakura |","rarity":"uncommon (least), rare (lesser), very rare (greater)","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
