{"slug":"beads-of-contemplation","name":"Beads of Contemplation","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This strand of eight wooden beads, each cleverly carved with geometric patterns, hangs from a stout length of cording. The beads store ki energy placed into them, holding the ki until you use it. The beads can store up to 8 ki points. At the end of a short or long rest, you can place ki energy into the beads by touching them and expending a number of ki points equal to half your proficiency bonus.\nWhile wearing or carrying the beads, you can use a bonus action to remove any number of ki points from the beads, regaining that amount of ki points and freeing up space in the beads.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"requires attunement by a monk","document__slug":"toh","document__title":"Tome of Heroes","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"}
