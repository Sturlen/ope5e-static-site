{"slug":"enraging-ammunition","name":"Enraging Ammunition","type":"Ammunition","desc":"When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this magical ammunition, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become enraged for 1 minute. On its turn, an enraged creature moves toward you by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of you. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but it moves around or avoids damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit. If the enraged creature is within 5 feet of you, it attacks you. An enraged creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
