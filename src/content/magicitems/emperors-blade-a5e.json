While activated, the barbs rapidly saw back and forth to tear into your foes, making your weapon attacks with the sword deal an extra 1d8 slashing damage.\n\nWhen you score a critical hit while the barbs are active, the sawing barbs leave a terrible wound that deals 1d8 ongoing damage. At the start of each of its turns, a wounded creature makes a Constitution _saving throw_  (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) to end the ongoing damage.",
