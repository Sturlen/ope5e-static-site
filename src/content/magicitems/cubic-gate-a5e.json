The other five sides are determined by the Narrator.\n\nAs an action, you may press one side of the cube and spend a charge to cast the _gate  s_pell, expending a charge and opening a portal to the associated plane. You may instead press a side twice, expending 2 charges and casting _plane shift_ (save DC 17) which sends the targets to the associated plane.",
