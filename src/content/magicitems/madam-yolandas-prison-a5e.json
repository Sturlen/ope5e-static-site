She lived a life of adventure and riches before eventually retiring in a vast mansion with a much younger elf. Identifying the ruby causes Madam Yolanda to appear—she uses the statistics of an _archmage_  fluent in Common and Elvish, and is vain, flirtatious, and mistrustful of almost everyone’s motives. The Narrator randomly determines her attitude towards her finders using the Madam Yolanda’s Prison table.\n\n__**Table: Madam Yolanda’s Prison**__\n| **d100** | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1–10     | Madam Yolanda is gravely offended by her discovery and attacks.
