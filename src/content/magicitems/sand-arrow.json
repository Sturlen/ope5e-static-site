    "desc": "The shaft of this arrow is made of tightly packed white sand that discorporates into a blast of grit when it strikes a target. On a hit, the sand catches in the fittings and joints of metal armor, and the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until it cleans or removes the armor. In addition, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.",
