As an action, you can make a DC 12 Performance check to send the cards flying through your hands, creating the appearance that the cut-outs are moving to tell a story of your choice. If you are standing near a light source, the story is cast on a nearby wall through shadowplay.\n\nOn a failed check, the storyâ€™s end is unsatisfying; if you fail by 5 or more, it takes a ghastly turn, ending in murder, betrayal, or gruesome death.",
