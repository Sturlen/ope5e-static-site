{"slug":"master-anglers-tackle","name":"Master Angler's Tackle","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This is a set of well-worn but finely crafted fishing gear. You have advantage on any Wisdom (Survival) checks made to catch fish or other seafood when using it. If you ever roll a 1 on your check while using the tackle, roll again. If the second roll is a 20, you still fail to catch anything edible, but you pull up something interesting or valuableâ€”a bottle with a note in it, a fragment of an ancient tablet carved in ancient script, a mermaid in need of help, or similar. The GM decides what you pull up and its value, if it has one.","rarity":"common","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
