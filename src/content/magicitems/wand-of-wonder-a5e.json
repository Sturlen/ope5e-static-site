{"slug":"wand-of-wonder-a5e","name":"Wand of Wonder","type":"Wand","desc":"While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and choose a creature, object, or point in space within 120 feet. Roll d100 on the Wand of Wonder table to determine the effect.\n\nSpells cast from the wand have a spell save DC of 15 and a range of 120 feet. Area effects are centered on and include the target. If an effect might target multiple creatures, the Narrator randomly determines which ones are affected.\n\nThis wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6+1 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\\. On a 1, the wand violently shakes and sparks with magic then disappears.\n\n__**Table: Wand of Wonder**__\n| **d100** | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 01–05    | You cast _slow ._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| 06–10    | You cast __faerie fire ._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 11–15    | You are awestruck and become _stunned_  until the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| 16–20    | You cast _gust of wind ._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 21–25    | You cast __detect thoughts_  on the target.
