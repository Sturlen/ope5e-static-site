{"slug":"lantern-of-auspex","name":"Lantern of Auspex","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This elaborate lantern is covered in simple glyphs, and its glass panels are intricately etched. Two of the panels depict a robed woman holding out a single hand, while the other two panels depict the same woman with her face partially obscured by a hand of cards. The lantern's magic is activated when it is lit, which requires an action. Once lit, the lantern sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet for 1 hour. You can use an action to open or close one of the glass panels on the lantern. If you open a panel, a vision of a random event that happened or that might happen plays out in the light's area. Closing a panel stops the vision. The visions are shown as nondescript smoky apparitions that play out silently in the lantern's light. At the GM's discretion, the vision might change to a different event each 1 minute that the panel remains open and the lantern lit. Once used, the lantern can't be used in this way again until 7 days have passed.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
