{"slug":"swolbold-wraps","name":"Swolbold Wraps","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"When wearing these cloth wraps, your forearms and hands swell to half again their normal size without negatively impacting your fine motor skills. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with unarmed strikes while wearing these wraps. In addition, your unarmed strike uses a d4 for damage and counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you hit a target with an unarmed strike and the target is no more than one size larger than you, you can use a bonus action to automatically grapple the target. Once this special bonus action has been used three times, it can't be used again until the next dawn.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
