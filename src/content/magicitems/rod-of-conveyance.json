{"slug":"rod-of-conveyance","name":"Rod of Conveyance","type":"Rod","desc":"The top of this rod is capped with a bronze horse head, and its foot is decorated with a horsehair plume. By placing the rod between your legs, you can use an action to temporarily transform the rod into a horse-like construct. This works like the phantom steed spell, except you can use a bonus action to end the effect early to use the rod again at a later time. Deduct the time the horse was active in increments of 1 minute from the spell's 1-hour duration. When the rod has been a horse for a total of 1 hour, the magic ceases to function until the next dawn.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
