{"slug":"flask-of-epiphanies","name":"Flask of Epiphanies","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This flask is made of silver and cherry wood, and it holds finely cut garnets on its faces. This ornate flask contains 5 ounces of powerful alcoholic spirits. As an action, you can drink up to 5 ounces of the flask's contents. You can drink 1 ounce without risk of intoxication. When you drink more than 1 ounce of the spirits as part of the same action, you must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw (this DC increases by 1 for each ounce you imbibe after the second, to a maximum of DC 15). On a failed save, you are incapacitated for 1d4 hours and gain no benefits from consuming the alcohol. On a success, your Intelligence or Wisdom (your choice) increases by 1 for each ounce you consumed. Whether you fail or succeed, your Dexterity is reduced by 1 for each ounce you consumed. The effect lasts for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) and Inteligence (Religion) checks. The flask replenishes 1d3 ounces of spirits daily at dawn.","rarity":"legendary","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
