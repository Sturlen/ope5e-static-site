{"slug":"shield-of-the-fallen","name":"Shield of the Fallen","type":"Armor","desc":"Your allies can use this shield to move you when you aren't capable of moving. If you are paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious, and a creature lays you on this shield, the shield rises up under you, bearing you and anything you currently wear or carry. The shield then follows the creature that laid you on the shield for up to 1 hour before gently lowering to the ground. This property otherwise works like the floating disk spell. Once used, the shield can't be used this way again for 1d12 hours.","rarity":"common","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
