    "desc": "Carved from a curious black stone of unknown origin, this small totem is fashioned in the macabre likeness of a Great Old One. While attuned to the idol and holding it, you gain the following benefits:\n- You can speak, read, and write Deep Speech.\n- You can use an action to speak the idol's command word and send otherworldly spirits to whisper in the minds of up to three creatures you can see within 30 feet of you. Each target must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 psychic damage and is frightened of you for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened. If a target dies from this damage or while frightened, the otherworldly spirits within the idol are temporarily sated, and you don't suffer the effects of the idol's Otherworldly Whispers property at the next dusk. Once used, this property of the idol can't be used again until the next dusk.\n- You can use an action to cast the augury spell from the idol. The idol can't be used this way again until the next dusk.",
