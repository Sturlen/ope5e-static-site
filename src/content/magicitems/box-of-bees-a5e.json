{"slug":"box-of-bees-a5e","name":"Box of Bees","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"Many apprentices play pranks on one another, some of which can be quite painfulâ€”the _box of bees_ is a particularly popular example and now sold by those with their own mischievous designs. Each of these wooden boxes is rectangular and approximately 2 inches long. It is usually unadorned, though some boxes seem to have something moving or vibrating inside.\n\nWhen you speak the command word and use an action to expend 1 charge, the lid slides open and a bee erupts out of the box to harass a creature of your choice within 20 feet. A creature harassed by the bee must succeed on a DC 5 Constitution _saving throw_  at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. On a failure, the creature makes its next attack roll or ability check with _disadvantage_ . \n\nWhen you speak another command word and expend all 3 charges, a dozen or more bees swarm out of the box and attack. A creature attacked by the bees must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution _saving throw_  at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. On a failure, the creature takes 1 point of damage and has _disadvantage_  on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 round. \n\nThe box has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20\\. On a result of 5 or less, the box loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.","rarity":"Uncommon","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
