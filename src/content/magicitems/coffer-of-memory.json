{"slug":"coffer-of-memory","name":"Coffer of Memory","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This small golden box resembles a jewelry box and is easily mistaken for a common trinket. When attuned to the box, its owner can fill the box with mental images of important events lasting no more than 1 minute each. Any number of memories can be stored this way. These images are similar to a slide show from the bearer's point of view. On a command from its owner, the box projects a mental image of a requested memory so that whoever is holding the box at that moment can see it. If a coffer of memory is found with memories already stored inside it, a newly-attuned owner can view a randomly-selected stored memory with a successful DC 15 Charisma check.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
