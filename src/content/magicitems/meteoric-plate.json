{"slug":"meteoric-plate","name":"Meteoric Plate","type":"Armor","desc":"This plate armor was magically crafted from plates of interlocking stone. Tiny rubies inlaid in the chest create a glittering mosaic of flames. When you fall while wearing this armor, you can tuck your knees against your chest and curl into a ball. While falling in this way, flames form around your body. You take half the usual falling damage when you hit the ground, and fire explodes from your form in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in this area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes fire damage equal to the falling damage you took, or half as much on a successful saving throw. The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
