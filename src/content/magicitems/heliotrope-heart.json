While attuned to this orb, your hit point maximum can't be reduced by the bite of a vampire, vampire spawn, or other vampiric creature. In addition, while holding this orb, you can use an action to speak its command word and cast the 2nd-level version of the false life spell. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dusk.",
