On your subsequent turns, you can use your bonus action to listen through the pearl, allowing you to hear as though you were there. This effect ends after ten minutes or if the wearer removes the necklace.\n\nOnce all pearls have been removed, the necklace becomes a mundane gold chain worth 30 gp.",
