{"slug":"pocket-spark","name":"Pocket Spark","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"What looks like a simple snuff box contains a magical, glowing ember. Though warm to the touch, the ember can be handled without damage. It can be used to ignite flammable materials quickly. Using it to light a torch, lantern, or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel takes a bonus action. Lighting any other fire takes an action. The ember is consumed when used. If the ember is consumed, the box creates a new ember at dawn.","rarity":"common","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
