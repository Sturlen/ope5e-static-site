    "desc": "This medium armor is made from the bones of several humanoids—ribs, shoulder, femurs and many others have been bound in leather and fused with necromantic magic—and while donned it imparts a touch of undeath to the wearer. While wearing this armor, you gain resistance to poison and necrotic damage, but also vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. As a bonus action, you can make the bones rattle to gain _advantage_  on the next Intimidation check you make this turn against a humanoid. It is in all other ways similar to chain mail, except that you don’t have _disadvantage_  on Stealth checks while wearing it.",
