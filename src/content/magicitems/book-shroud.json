{"slug":"book-shroud","name":"Book Shroud","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"When not bound to a book, this red leather book cover is embossed with images of eyes on every inch of its surface. When you wrap this cover around a tome, it shifts the book's appearance to a plain red cover with a title of your choosing and blank pages on which you can write. When viewing the wrapped book, other creatures see the plain red version with any contents you've written. A creature succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check sees the real book and can remove the shroud.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
