    "desc": "While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command word and see through solid objects and matter in a 30-foot radius for 1 minute. Solid objects within the radius appear ghostly and transparent, allowing light to pass through them. You can see through up 3 feet of wood and dirt, 1 foot of stone, and 1 inch of common metal (thicker materials or a thin sheet of lead block the vision).\n\nWhen you use this ring again before taking a _long rest_ , you make a DC 15 Constitution _saving throw_  or suffer one level of _fatigue_  and one level of _strife_ .",
