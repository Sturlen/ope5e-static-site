{"slug":"elixir-of-deep-slumber","name":"Elixir of Deep Slumber","type":"Potion","desc":"The milky-white liquid in this vial smells of jasmine and sandalwood. When you drink this potion, you fall into a deep sleep, from which you can't be physically awakened, for 1 hour. A successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on you awakens you but cancels any beneficial effects of the elixir. When you awaken at the end of the hour, you benefit from the sleep as if you had finished a long rest.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
