    "desc": "This silvery rod is set with rubies on each end. One end holds rubies shaped to resemble an open, fanged maw, and the other end's rubies are shaped to resemble a heart. While holding this rod, you can use an action to spend one or more Hit Dice, up to half your maximum Hit Dice, while pointing the heart-shaped ruby end of the rod at a target within 60 feet of you. For each Hit Die spent in this way, you roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You lose hit points equal to the total, and the target regains hit points equal to the total hit points you lost. You can't use this feature if you don't have blood. Hit Dice spent on this feature can't be used to regain hit points during a short rest. You regain spent Hit Dice as normal.",
