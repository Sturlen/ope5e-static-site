{"slug":"wand-of-fireballs","name":"Wand of Fireballs","type":"Wand","desc":"This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the _fireball_ spell (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.\n\nThe wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement by a spellcaster","document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"5e Core Rules","document__url":"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"}
