{"slug":"eversmoking-bottle-a5e","name":"Eversmoking Bottle","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"This glass bottle is filled with whirling smoke. You can use an action to remove the stopper, causing a thick cloud to pour out and fill a 60-foot radius centered on the bottle, making the area _heavily obscured_ . The cloud grows by 10 feet for each minute that the bottle remains open, to a maximum radius of 120 feet.\n\nThe cloud remains until the bottle is closed. Closing the bottle requires the itemâ€™s command word and an action, after which the smoke disperses after 10 minutes. Moderate winds disperse the smoke after 1 minute. Strong winds disperse the smoke after 1 round.","rarity":"Uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
