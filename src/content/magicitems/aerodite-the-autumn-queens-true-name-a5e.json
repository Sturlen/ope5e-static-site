    "desc": "This slip of parchment contains the magically bound name “Airy Nightengale” surrounded by shifting autumn leaves. While you are attuned to it, you can use a bonus action to invoke the name on this parchment to summon a vision of a powerful _archfey_  beside you for 1 minute. Airy acts catty and dismissive but mellows with flattery. Once a vision is summoned in this way, it cannot be summoned again for the next 24 hours.\n\nYou can use an action to verbally direct the vision to do any of the following: \n\n* Perform minor acts of nature magic (as _druidcraft_ ).\n* Whisper charming words to a target creature within 5 feet. Creatures whispered to in this way must make a DC 13 Charisma _saving throw_ , on a failed save targets become _charmed_  by the vision until the end of their next turn, treating the vision and you as friendly allies.\n* Bestow a magical fly speed of 10 feet on a creature within 5 feet for as long as the vision remains.\n\nAlternatively, as an action while the vision is summoned you can agree to revoke your claim on Aerodite in exchange for her direct assistance. When you do so the parchment disappears in a flurry of autumn leaves, and for the next minute the figment transforms into an alluring vision of the Dreaming at a point you choose within 60 feet (as __hypnotic pattern_ , save DC 13). Once you have revoked your claim in this way, you can never invoke Aerodite’s true name again.",
