    "desc": "This stunningly crafted bouquet contains 2d10 magically fresh flowersâ€”most commonly roses. As an action, you may pluck one from the bouquet while concentrating on your intent. The flower may function as a _scroll_  of _identify , detect poison and disease ,_ or __detect magic_ . The effect lasts for one minute, after which the flower withers and dies.\n\nIf the bouquet is made up of seven roses or more, you can burn it to cast a _divination_  spell, revealing the answer to the question asked in the sweetly-scented smoke. Doing so destroys the bouquet.",
