    "desc": "This block of perfumed incense appears to be normal, nonmagical incense until lit. The incense burns for 1 hour and gives off a lavender scent, accompanied by pale mauve smoke that lightly obscures the area within 30 feet of it. Each spellcaster that takes a short rest in the smoke regains one expended spell slot at the end of the short rest.",
