{"slug":"candle-of-the-surreptitious-scholar-a5e","name":"Candle of the Surreptitious Scholar","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"Initially crafted by wizard apprentices trying not to irritate their roommates, these candles became extremely popular with the thieves and other ne'er do wells that can afford them (helping some less scrupulous novice mages to afford tuition). The candle has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. \n\nWhen you speak the command word and use an action to expend 1 charge, the candleâ€™s flame to spring to life. Its bluish flame provides clear illumination within 5 feet and _dim light_  for another 5 feet. The enchantment of the candle is such that the light that it sheds is visible only to you, allowing you to read, write, or engage in other tasks with no penalties from darkness. Each charge is good for 1 hour of illumination, after which the candle winks out. \n\nBy expending all 3 charges at once, you can create an effect identical to _light_  except that only you are able to see the light it sheds.\n\nIf you expend the last charge, roll a d20\\. On a result of 5 or less, the candle loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.","rarity":"Uncommon","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
