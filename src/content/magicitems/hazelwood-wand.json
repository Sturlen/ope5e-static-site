When you cast the goodberry spell while using this wand as your spellcasting focus, you can expend 1 of the wand's charges to transform the berries into hazelnuts, which restore 2 hit points instead of 1. The spell is otherwise unchanged. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals lightning damage while using this wand as your spellcasting focus, the spell deals 1 extra lightning damage.",
