    "desc": "This wand is tipped with a feather. The wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and point the wand at a humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be forced to giggle for 1 minute. Giggling doesn't prevent a target from taking actions or moving. The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the wand transforms into a Wand of Tears.",
