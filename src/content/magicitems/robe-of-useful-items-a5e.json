{"slug":"robe-of-useful-items-a5e","name":"Robe of Useful Items","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"Leather patches of various shapes and colors are sewn into this robe. While attuned to and wearing the robe, you can use an action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe loses its magical properties.\n\nThe robe has two of each of the following patches: \n\n* _Dagger_\n* _Bullseye lantern_  (filled and lit)\n* _Steel mirror_\n* 10-foot _pole_\n* _Hempen rope_  (50 feet, coiled)\n* _Sack_\n\nIn addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches (either chosen by the Narrator or randomly determined).\n\n__**Table: Robe of Useful
