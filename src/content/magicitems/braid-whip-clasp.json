{"slug":"braid-whip-clasp","name":"Braid Whip Clasp","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This intricately carved ivory clasp can be wrapped around or woven into braided hair 3 feet or longer. While the clasp is attached to your braided hair, you can speak its command word as a bonus action and transform your braid into a dangerous whip. If you speak the command word again, you end the effect. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic whip. When the clasp's property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, you can't use it to transform your braid into a whip again until the next dawn.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
