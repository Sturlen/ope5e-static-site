{"slug":"blackbird-pie-a5e","name":"Blackbird Pie","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"This item appears to be a freshly baked pie in a tin. When the crust is fully punctured the pie explodes as 24 magic blackbirds fly out and flit through the air in a 20-foot radius for 2d4 rounds, at which point the birds and the pie disappear. A creature that starts its turn in the area or first enters into the area on its turn makes a DC 15 Dexterity _saving throw_ , taking 1 slashing damage on a failure. A creature damaged by the blackbirds has _disadvantage_  on ability checks and _attack rolls_  until the beginning of its next turn. The blackbirds are magical and cannot be interacted with like normal animals, and attacking them has no effect.","rarity":"Uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
