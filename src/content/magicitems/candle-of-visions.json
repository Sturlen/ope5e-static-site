{"slug":"candle-of-visions","name":"Candle of Visions","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This black candle burns with an eerie, blue flame. The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. When lit, the candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Each creature in the candle's light has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on divination spells. After burning for 1 hour, or if the flame is magically or nonmagically snuffed out, it is destroyed. Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the augury spell with it, which reveals its otherworldly omen in the candle's smoke. Doing so destroys the candle.","rarity":"common","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
