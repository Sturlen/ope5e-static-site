    "desc": "This thumb-sized opal is carved to resemble an open eye. As an action, you can affix it to your forehead where it remains in place until you use another action to remove it. While you wear the eye, you gain an expertise die on Insight checks you make while speaking telepathically with another creature.\n\nThe eye has 3 charges and regains 1 charge each dusk. You can use an action to expend 2 charges and cast _detect thoughts_  on any creature with whom you have communicated telepathically during the last 24 hours, regardless of your distance from the creature. Alternatively, you can expend 3 charges to cast _clairvoyance_ centered on the creature’s current location.\n\nWhen you expend the eye’s last charge, it permanently affixes to your forehead but otherwise becomes a normal opal.",
