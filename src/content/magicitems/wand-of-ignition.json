While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to set fire to one flammable object or collection of material (a stack of paper, a pile of kindling, or similar) within 10 feet of you that is Small or smaller. The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the wand transforms into a Wand of Extinguishing.",
