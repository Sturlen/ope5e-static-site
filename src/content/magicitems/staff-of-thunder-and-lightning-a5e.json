Additionally, while holding it you can activate one of the following properties, each of which can be used once per dawn.\n\n**_Lightning._** When you make a successful melee attack with the staff, you deal an extra 2d6 lightning damage.\n\n_**Thunder.**_ When you make a successful melee attack with the staff, you cause it to emit a thunderclap audible up to 300 feet away. The target makes a DC 17 Constitution _saving throw_  or it is _stunned_  until the end of your next turn.\n\n_**Lightning Strike.**_ You can use an action to fire a 120 feet long and 5 foot wide line of lightning from the staff.

On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t deafened.\n\n_**Thunder and Lightning**._ You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties simultaneously.
