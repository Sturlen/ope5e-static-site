    "desc": "This unassuming-looking signet ring comes with sinister features. The first is a four-chambered extradimensional space, each of which can hold one dose of poison. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to press part of its filigree to deploy one of the poisons and apply it to a weapon or piece of ammunition. You have _advantage_  on checks made to conceal this action from observers. \n\nIn addition, you can use a bonus action to whisper a command word that makes a garrote of shadowy force unspool from the ring. A creature _grappled_  using this garrote has _disadvantage_  on _saving throws_  made to escape the grapple.\n\nThis ring’s magic is subtle and creatures have _disadvantage_  on checks made to notice it is magical or determine its purpose.",
