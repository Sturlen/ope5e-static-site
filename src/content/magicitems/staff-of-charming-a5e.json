    "desc": "While holding this magical quarterstaff you can use an action and expend charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC: _charm person_  (1 charge), _command_ (1 charge), _comprehend languages_ (1 charge).\n\nOnce per dawn, when you are holding the staff and fail a _saving throw_  against an enchantment spell, you can instead choose to succeed. When you succeed on a saving throw against an enchantment spell (with or without the staffâ€™s intervention) you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster (targeting only them), as if you had cast the spell.\n\nThe staff has 10 charges and regains 1d8+2 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\\. On a 1, it loses its magical properties.",
