While wearing this surcoat, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks when interacting with horses, and you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with humanoids of a higher social rank than you, such as an army’s general or a region’s monarch.\n  ***Knight’s Livery.*** While attuned to and wearing both the *knightsergeant’s surcoat* and the *argent mantle*, your Charisma score is 20. This has no effect on you if your Charisma is already 20 or higher.",
