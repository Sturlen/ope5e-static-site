If you are wearing this paw when you fail an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll the roll with a +10 bonus. You must take the second roll. When you use this property of the paw, one of its fingers curls tight to the palm. When all five fingers are curled tightly into a fist, the monkey's paw loses its magic.","rarity":"very rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
