    "desc": "This small black pendant has 5 charges and regains 1d4 charges each day at dawn.\n\nYou can use an action and expend a charge to make undead of CR 1 or lower indifferent to you and creatures you choose within 30 feet of you. Undead remain indifferent until you for up to 1 hour, or until you threaten or harm them.\n\nThree times each day you can use a bonus action and expend a charge to summon a skeleton (page 334 or zombie (page 335). Your summoned creature follows you and is hostile to creatures that are hostile to you. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete. Undead created by the pendant turn into dust at dawn.",
