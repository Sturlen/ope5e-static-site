    "desc": "Silver runes decorate the hairy legs and plump abdomen of this fist-sized preserved spider. You can use an action to throw the spider up to 30 feet. It explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 20-foot radius of where the spider landed must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by sticky webbing. A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained. In addition, the webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire. The webs also naturally unravel after 1 hour.",
