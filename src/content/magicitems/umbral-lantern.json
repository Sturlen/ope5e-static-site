    "desc": "This item looks like a typical hooded brass lantern, but shadowy forms crawl across its surface and it radiates darkness instead of light. The lantern can burn for up to 3 hours each day. While the lantern burns, it emits darkness as if the darkness spell were cast on it but with a 30-foot radius.",
