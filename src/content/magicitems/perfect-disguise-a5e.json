{"slug":"perfect-disguise-a5e","name":"Perfect Disguise","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"This set of novelty glasses has a comically-oversized false nose along with a thick fake mustache and bushy eyebrows. These glasses have 3 charges and regain 1 charge each dawn. While wearing the glasses you can expend 1 charge to cast the spell __disguise self_  (save DC 14). \n\nHowever, you cannot mask the glasses themselves using __disguise self_  in this wayâ€”no matter how your disguise looks, it includes the novelty glasses.\n\nIf you expend the last charge, roll a d20\\. On a result of 5 or less, the _perfect disguise_ is glued to your face (as _sovereign glue_ ) and it becomes a mundane item.","rarity":"Uncommon","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
