{"slug":"potion-of-bad-taste","name":"Potion of Bad Taste","type":"Potion","desc":"This brown, sludgy potion tastes extremely foul. When you drink this potion, the taste of your flesh is altered to be unpalatable for 1 hour. During this time, if a creature hits you with a bite attack, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or spend its next action gagging and retching. A creature with an Intelligence of 4 or lower avoids biting you again unless compelled or commanded by an outside force or if you attack it.","rarity":"common","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
