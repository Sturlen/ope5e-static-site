While holding the morningstar, you can fire one of the spikes as a ranged attack, using your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls. This attack has a normal range of 100 feet and a long range of 200 feet. On a hit, the spike deals 1d8 piercing damage. Once all of the weapon's spikes have been fired, the morningstar deals bludgeoning damage instead of the piercing damage normal for a morningstar until the next dawn, at which time the spikes regrow.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
