You gain a +2 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with this razor. A number of times per day equal to half your proficiency bonus, when you hit with a melee attack you can use a bonus action to channel the inherent hatred of the razor, dealing 2d6 necrotic damage.\n\n_**Curse.**_ Once attuned to this weapon, you are _cursed_  until you are targeted by _remove curse_ or similar magic. Your appearance and manner have a hint of murderous rage at all times, giving you _disadvantage_  on Charisma checks and making beasts hostile towards you. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with any other weapon and must make a DC 14 Wisdom _saving throw_  to willingly part with the razor, even temporarily.","rarity":"Rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
