    "desc": "This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:\n\n* The first command word can be used as a bonus action to cause the gem to shed _bright light_  in a 30-foot radius and _dim light_  for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn’t expend any charges and lasts until you repeat the first command word or use one of the other two.\n* The second command word requires an action and expends 1 charge, causing the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet. The creature makes a DC 15 Constitution _saving throw_  or becomes _blinded_  for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n* The third command word requires an action and expends 5 charges, causing the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Constitution _saving throw_  or becomes _blinded_  for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nWhen all of the gem’s charges are expended it loses all magical properties, becoming a mundane jewel worth 50 gold.",
