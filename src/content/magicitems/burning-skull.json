According to legends, gazing upon a burning skull freezes the blood and withers the brain of one who understands not its mystery.","rarity":"very rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
