{"slug":"ring-of-shooting-stars-a5e","name":"Ring of Shooting Stars","type":"Ring","desc":"While wearing this ring, if you are in _dim light or darkness_  you can use an action to cast _dancing lights_ or _light_. The ring has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges at dawn.\n\n**Faerie Fire.** You can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast _faerie fire ._\n\n**Ball Lightning**. You can use an action and expend 2 charges to create up to four 3-foot-diameter lightning spheres. The number of spheres created determines each sphere’s intensity (see Table: Ball Lightning), each sheds light in a 30-foot radius, and they remain up to 1 minute as long as you _concentrate_  (as if concentrating on a spell). As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no further than 120 feet from you.\n\nWhen a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and then disappears. The creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity _saving throw_  or takes lightning damage based on the sphere’s intensity.\n\nShooting Stars. You can use an action to expend 1 to 3 charges. For each expended charge, you shoot a glittering mote of light at a point you can see within 60 feet where it explodes in a 15-foot-cube of sparks. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Dexterity _saving throw_ , taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success.\n\n__**Table: Ball Lightning**__\n| **Spheres** | **Lightning Damage** |\n| ----------- | -------------------- |\n| 1           | 4d12                 |\n| 2           | 5d4                  |\n| 3           | 2d6                  |\n| 4           | 2d4                  |","rarity":"Very Rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
