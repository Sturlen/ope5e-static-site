    "desc": "When a magic mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows an insubstantial otherworldly face looking back at you. Magic mirrors can be found in three sizes.\n\n_**Pocket (Uncommon).**_ While attuned to the pocket mirror, you can use it as a _spellcasting_  focus, and twice per dawn cast _augury_  as you look into it. When you do so, your reflection whispers the answers to your questions.\n\n**Handheld (Rare).** While attuned to the handheld mirror, you can use it as a _spellcasting_  focus, and you can cast _augury_ and __divination_  once each per dawn as you look into it. Your reflection whispers the answers to your questions.\n\n**Wall (Very Rare).** While this bulky mirror is securely fastened to a wall, twice per dawn you can look into it and speak a command phrase to cast _commune , contact other plane ,_ or __divination_ . Your reflection answers your questions. Additionally, as an action once per dawn, the wall mirror can be linked to another _magic mirror_ by speaking the name of the other mirror’s bearer, initiating a face to face conversation that can last up to 10 minutes. Both you and the other mirror user can clearly see each other’s faces, but don’t get any sense of one another’s surroundings. Either you or the other mirror user can use a bonus action to end the conversation early.",
