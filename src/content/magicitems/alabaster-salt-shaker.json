It is 7 inches tall and contains enough salt to flavor 25 meals. When the shaker is empty, it can't be refilled, and it becomes nonmagical. When you or another creature eat a meal salted by this shaker, you don't need to eat again for 48 hours, at which point the magic wears off. If you don't eat within 1 hour of the magic wearing off, you gain one level of exhaustion. You continue gaining one level of exhaustion for each additional hour you don't eat.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
