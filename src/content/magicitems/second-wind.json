{"slug":"second-wind","name":"Second Wind","type":"Ring","desc":"This plain, copper band holds a clear, spherical crystal. When you run out of breath or are choking, you can use a reaction to activate the ring.

A shattered crystal magically reforms at the next dawn.","rarity":"common","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
