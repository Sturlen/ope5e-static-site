{"slug":"ferrymans-coins","name":"Ferryman's Coins","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"It is customary in many faiths to weight a corpse's eyes with pennies so they have a fee to pay the ferryman when he comes to row them across death's river to the afterlife. Ferryman's coins, though, ensure the body stays in the ground regardless of the spirit's destination. These coins, which feature a death's head on one side and a lock and chain on the other, prevent a corpse from being raised as any kind of undead. When you place two coins on a corpse's closed lids and activate them with a simple prayer, they can't be removed unless the person is resurrected (in which case they simply fall away), or someone makes a DC 15 Strength check to remove them. Yanking the coins away does no damage to the corpse.","rarity":"common","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
