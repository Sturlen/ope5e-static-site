{"slug":"fools-hat-a5e","name":"Fool's Hat","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"This extraordinary hat comes to several points, each with a bell affixed to it. A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, you can snap your fingers as an action and become _invisible_ . The invisibility lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you attack, deal damage, cast a spell, or force a creature to make a _saving throw_ . However, the sound of bells jingling means your location is always known if you use any movement.","rarity":"Common","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
