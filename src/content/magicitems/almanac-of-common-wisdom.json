The topics change to match information relevant to the area where it is currently located. If you spend a short rest consulting the almanac, you treat your proficiency bonus as 1 higher when making any Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill checks to discover, recall, or cite information about local events, locations, or creatures for the next 4 hours. For example, this almanac's magic can help you recall and find the location of a city's oldest tavern, but its magic won't help you notice a thug hiding in an alley near the tavern.",
