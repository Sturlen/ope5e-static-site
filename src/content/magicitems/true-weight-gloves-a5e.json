{"slug":"true-weight-gloves-a5e","name":"True Weight Gloves","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"This set of emerald green gloves are made from velvet with very fine silk stitching and function as a small scale. While wearing them, you can hold two objects in your hands and know the exact weight of the objects. The objects must be of a size and weight that allow you to hold your arms straight out with one in each open palm. While using the gloves to weigh objects, you can speak a command word that makes them disappear in a puff of green smoke if either object is counterfeit.","rarity":"Common","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
