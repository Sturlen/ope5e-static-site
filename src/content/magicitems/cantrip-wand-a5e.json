{"slug":"cantrip-wand-a5e","name":"Cantrip Wand","type":"Wand","desc":"This wand can be used as a spellcasting focus and allows you to cast one additional cantrip as if you knew it, as long as it is on your spell list. Each cantrip wand has a cantrip imbued within it upon creation, and will be known by its name (such as a _fire bolt_  wand or __light  wand_). \n\nOther implements exist for the storing of cantrips from other classes (like _cantrip holy symbols_ or _cantrip instruments_), and though these are wondrous items they function like wands.","rarity":"Uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
