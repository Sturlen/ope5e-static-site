The gremlin watches a particular device or mechanism. One minute after the device is triggered, the gremlin emerges from its frame, performs whatever actions are necessary to reset the device, and returns to its frame.\n\nThe gremlin is ethereal and unable to interact with objects and creatures on the Material Plane other than its frame and the device it watches.",
