{"slug":"inspiring-pahu-a5e","name":"Inspiring Pahu","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"This large bass drum is made from hearty kamani (a wood light in color and native to far away islands) covered in cured sharkskin. Carvings all around the instrument depict warriors engaged in song and dance around a giant funeral pyre, and a leather strap hangs from its side to secure the drum at the waist. When struck the drum creates a deep resonant sound that sets the tempo for a song, an excellent tool for motivating warriors before battle.\n\nThis drum has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. You can use a bonus action to play it and expend 1 charge, focusing its energies on a living creature that has 0 hit points and that you can see within 20 feet. Until the start of your next turn, the creature has _advantage_  on death _saving throws_ .\n\nAlternatively, you can use an action to play it and expend 2 charges. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play makes a DC 20 Constitution _saving throw_ . On a success, a creature gains inspiration. \n\nIf you expend the last charge, roll a d20\\. On a result of 5 or less, the sharkskin membrane covering the drum breaks and it becomes a mundane item.","rarity":"Uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
