{"slug":"goggles-of-firesight","name":"Goggles of Firesight","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"The lenses of these combination fleshy and plantlike goggles extend a few inches away from the goggles on a pair of tentacles. While wearing these lenses, you can see through lightly obscured and heavily obscured areas without your vision being obscured, if those areas are obscured by fire, smoke, or fog. Other effects that would obscure your vision, such as rain or darkness, affect you normally. When you fail a saving throw against being blinded, you can use a reaction to call on the power within the goggles. If you do so, you succeed on the saving throw instead. The goggles can't be used this way again until the next dawn.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
