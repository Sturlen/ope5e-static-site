At the start of your turn, you can choose to allow attack rolls against you to have advantage. If you do, the glyphs shed dim light in a 5-foot radius, and you can use a reaction when a creature hits you with an attack to force the attacker to take necrotic damage equal to twice your proficiency bonus.",
