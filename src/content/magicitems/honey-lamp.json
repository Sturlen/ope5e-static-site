{"slug":"honey-lamp","name":"Honey Lamp","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"Honey lamps, made from glowing honey encased in beeswax, shed light as a lamp. Though the lamps are often found in the shape of a globe, the honey can also be sealed inside stone or wood recesses. If the wax that shields the honey is broken or smashed, the honey crystallizes in 7 days and ceases to glow. Eating the honey while it is still glowing grants darkvision out to a range of 30 feet for 1 week and 1 day.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
