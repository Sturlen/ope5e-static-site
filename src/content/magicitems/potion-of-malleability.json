When you drink this potion, your body becomes extremely flexible and adaptable to pressure. For 1 hour, you have resistance to bludgeoning damage, can squeeze through a space large enough for a creature two sizes smaller than you, and have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to escape a grapple.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
