    "desc": "Strands of white mycelium cover the head of this gnarled wooden staff. When tapped on the ground, the staff sheds a thin coating of dirt. While attuned to the staff, you suffer no harmful effects from _diseases_  but can still carry diseases and spread them to others. When you hit a creature with this staff, you can force the target to make a DC 12 Constitution _saving throw_ . On a failure, it contracts one disease of your choice that youâ€™re currently carrying.",
