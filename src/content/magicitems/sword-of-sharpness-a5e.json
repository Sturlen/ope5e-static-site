    "desc": "Objects hit with this sword take the maximum damage the weapon’s damage dice can deal.\n\nWhen you use this sword to _make an attack_  against a creature and roll a natural 20, the target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage. Then roll an additional d20, and on a natural 20 you chop off one of the target’s limbs (or a portion of its body if it has no limbs). The Narrator determines what effect (if any) the result of this severing off is.\n\nYou may also speak this sword’s command word to make the blade emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light an additional 10 feet. Repeating the command word or sheathing the sword extinguishes the blade’s light.",
