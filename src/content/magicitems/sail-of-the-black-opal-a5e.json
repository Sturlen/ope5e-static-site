    "desc": "Rumored to be crafted from the sailcloth of the notorious Black Opal, this heavy black canvas has been roughly sewn with human hair into a cloak.\n\nAs a bonus action you can expend one charge to call on the shipâ€™s necromantic power and gain 1d4+4 temporary hit points. The sail has 3 charges and regains 1 charge for every hour spent submerged in seawater.\n\nAdditionally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points while attuned to this item, you immediately become stable as the hair burns to ash, blowing away at the faintest breeze and leaving behind a mundane piece of bone-dry sailcloth.
