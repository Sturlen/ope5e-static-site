{"slug":"cephalopod-breastplate","name":"Cephalopod Breastplate","type":"Armor","desc":"This bronze breastplate depicts two krakens fighting. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can use an action to speak the armor's command word to release a cloud of black mist (if above water) or black ink (if underwater). It billows out from you in a 20-foot-radius cloud of mist or ink. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) or a significant current disperses it. The armor can't be used this way again until the next dawn.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
