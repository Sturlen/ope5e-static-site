While attuned, you gain an _expertise die_  on Performance checks made with this guitar. Additionally, once per day, you may use an action to cast __bestow curse_  as a 5th-level spell, without spending a spell slot. However, the curse is always _disadvantage_  on Dexterity _ability checks_  and _saving throws_  and each failure is followed by a slapstick sound effect.","rarity":"Rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
