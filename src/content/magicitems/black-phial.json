{"slug":"black-phial","name":"Black Phial","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This black stone phial has a tightly fitting stopper and 3 charges. As an action, you can fill the phial with blood taken from a living, or recently deceased (dead no longer than 1 minute), humanoid and expend 1 charge. When you do so, the black phial transforms the blood into a potion of greater healing. A creature who drinks this potion must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. The phial regains 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the phial's last charge, roll a d20: 1d20. On a 1, the phial crumbles into dust and is destroyed.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
