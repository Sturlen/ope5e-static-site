When you open the bottle, roll to d100 to determine the effect.\n\n__**Table: Efreeti Bottle**__\n| **d100** | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 01–10    | The efreeti attacks you. The Efreeti departs after 5 rounds pass or losing half its hit points, whichever happens first, and the bottle becomes a mundane item.                                                                                                                                                    |\n| 11–90    | The efreeti serves you for up to 1 hour before being drawn back into the bottle. The bottle cannot be opened again for 24 hours. This effect occurs automatically the second and third time the bottle is opened. The fourth time the bottle is opened, the efreeti vanishes and the bottle loses its enchantment. |\n| 91–100   | The efreeti grants you 3 wishes (as the _wish_ spell) then vanishes after an hour or after granting the final wish, and the bottle becomes a mundane item.                                                                                                                                                         |","rarity":"Very Rare","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
