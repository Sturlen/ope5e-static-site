    "desc": "When you place one or more pieces of nonmagical ammunition into this bejeweled leather quiver, after 1 hour each is imbued with elemental power determined by the gem used in its construction. An elementally-imbued piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d4 elemental damage (see Table: Elemental Quiver). The enchantment begins to fade after the ammunition is removed from the quiver and vanishes entirely after 1 minute. Each piece of ammunition imbued with elemental power expends 1 charge from the quiver. The quiver has 20 charges and regains 1d4+2 charges each dawn.\n\n__Table: Elemental Quiver__\n| **Gem**  | **Elemental Damage** |\n| -------- | -------------------- |\n| Diamond  | Lightning            |\n| Emerald  | Acid                 |\n| Ruby     | Fire                 |\n| Sapphire | Cold                 |",
