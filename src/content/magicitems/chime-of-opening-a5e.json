The chime sounds and one lock or latch on the object opens as long as the sound can reach the object. If no closures remain, the object itself opens. After being struck 10 times, the chime cracks and becomes useless.","rarity":"Rare","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
