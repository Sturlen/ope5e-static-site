    "desc": "This box houses a set of 34 illustrated cards when new. A found deck is typically missing 1d20 cards. \n\nAs an action, you can draw a random card (one manually selected does nothing) and throw it up to 30 feet from you. \n\nUpon landing, the card creates an illusion of one or more creatures. These illusions are of normal size for the creatures depicted and act normally, but are insubstantial and harmless. While you are within 120 feet of the illusion, you can use an action to move it anywhere within 30 feet from its card. \n\nThe illusions are revealed to a creature when it uses an action to make a DC 15 Investigation check or automatically upon any physical interaction. Once revealed, an illusion becomes translucent.\n\nThe illusion lasts until its card is moved or it is dispelled. In either case the card disappears and cannot be reused.\n\n__**Table: Deck of Illusions**__\n| **Playing Card**    | **Illusion**                 |\n| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| ‚ô£ Ace of Clubs      | Iron golem                   |\n| ‚ô£ King of Clubs     | Erinyes                      |\n| ‚ô£ Jack of Clubs     | Berserker                    |\n| ‚ô£ Ten of Clubs      | Hill giant                   |\n| ‚ô£ Nine of Clubs     | Ogre                         |\n| ‚ô£ Eight of Clubs    | Orc                          |\n| ‚ô£ Two of Clubs      | Kobold                       |\n| ‚ô¶ Ace of Diamonds   | Murmuring worm               |\n| ‚ô¶ King of Diamonds  | Archmage and mage apprentice |\n| ‚ô¶ Queen of Diamonds | Night hag                    |\n| ‚ô¶ Jack of Diamonds  | Assassin                     |\n| ‚ô¶ Ten of Diamonds   | Fire giant                   |\n| ‚ô¶ Nine of Diamonds  | Ogre mage                    |\n| ‚ô¶ Eight of Diamonds | Gnoll                        |\n| ‚ô¶ Two of Diamonds   | Kobold                       |\n| ‚ô• Ace of Hearts     | Red dragon                   |\n| ‚ô• King of Hearts    | Knight and 4 guards          |\n| ‚ô• Queen of Hearts   | Incubus/Succubus             |\n| ‚ô• Jack of Hearts    | Druid                        |\n| ‚ô• Ten of Hearts     | Cloud giant                  |\n| ‚ô• Nine of Hearts    | Ettin                        |\n| ‚ô• Eight of Hearts   | Bugbear                      |\n| ‚ô• Two of Hearts     | Goblin                       |\n| ‚ô† Ace of Spades     | Lich                         |\n| ‚ô† King of Spades    | Priest and 2 acolytes        |\n| ‚ô† Queen of Spades   | Medusa                       |\n| ‚ô† Jack of Spades    | Veteran                      |\n| ‚ô† Ten of Spades     | Frost giant                  |\n| ‚ô† Nine of Spades    | Troll                        |\n| ‚ô† Eight of Spades   | Hobgoblin                    |\n| ‚ô† Two of Spades     | Goblin                       |\n| üÉè Joker (2)        | The deck‚Äôs wielder           |",
