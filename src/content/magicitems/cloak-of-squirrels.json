{"slug":"cloak-of-squirrels","name":"Cloak of Squirrels","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This wool brocade cloak features a repeating pattern of squirrel heads and tree branches. It has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast the legion of rabid squirrels spell (see Deep Magic for 5th Edition) from it. You don't need to be in a forest to cast the spell from this cloak, as the squirrels come from within the cloak. When the spell ends, the swarm vanishes back inside the cloak.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
