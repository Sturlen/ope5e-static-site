{"slug":"chariot-a-la-calabaza-a5e","name":"Chariot a la Calabaza","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"The original chariot a la Calabaza was created by a powerful wizard with a penchant for transmutation and riding in style. It is pulled by two spectral stallions with flowing manes and tails, who function as per the __phantom steed_  spell. As an action, you may speak the command word to transform the chariot into a pumpkin two feet in diameter. Speaking the command word again transforms the pumpkin into a carriage and resummons the horses.\n\nWhile in pumpkin form, the chariot is, in truth, a pumpkin, except that it does not naturally decay. Attempts to carve, smash, or draw upon the pumpkin are reflected onto the chariotâ€™s form when it reappears, although the horses seem to remain unscathed regardless of such events.","rarity":"Rare","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
