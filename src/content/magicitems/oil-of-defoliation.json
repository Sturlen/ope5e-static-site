One vial of the oily substance can coat one weapon or up to 5 pieces of ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to plants or plant creatures on a successful hit. The oil can also be applied directly to a willing, restrained, or immobile plant or plant creature. In this case, the substance deals 4d6 necrotic damage, which is enough to kill most ordinary plant life smaller than a large tree.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
