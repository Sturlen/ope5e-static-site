{"slug":"shield-of-missile-reversal","name":"Shield of Missile Reversal","type":"Armor","desc":"While wielding this shield, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. When you would be struck by a ranged attack, you can use a reaction to cause the outer surface of the shield to emit a flash of magical energy, sending the missile hurtling back at your attacker. Make a ranged weapon attack roll against your attacker using the attacker's bonuses on the roll. If the attack hits, roll damage as normal, using the attacker's bonuses.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
