When you drink this potion, you regenerate lost hit points for 1 hour. At the start of your turn, you regain 5 hit points. If you take acid or fire damage, the potion doesn't function at the start of your next turn. If you lose a limb, you can reattach it by holding it in place for 1 minute. For the duration, you can die from damage only by being reduced to 0 hit points and not regenerating on your turn.","rarity":"very rare","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
