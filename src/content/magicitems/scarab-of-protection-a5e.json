{"slug":"scarab-of-protection-a5e","name":"Scarab of Protection","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"After being held in your hand for 1 round, this scarab medallion shimmers with magical inscriptions. The scarab has 12 charges, crumbling into dust when it has no charges left. \n\nThis item has two benefits while it is on your person. First, you gain _advantage_  on _saving throws_  made against spells. Second, if you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or either an attack from or trait of an undead creature, you may instead succeed on the saving throw by using your reaction to expend a charge from the scarab.","rarity":"Legendary","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
