    "desc": "This ordinary bag, made from cured animal hide, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a number of flat, bone tiles. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.\n  You can use an action to pull one of the tiles from the bag and throw it into the air in front of you. The tile floats 5 feet off the ground and displays a runic symbol. Make a DC 12 Wisdom check. The symbol on the tile is upright on a successful save, and it is reversed on a failed save. Roll a d12 and consult the appropriate table to determine the rune’s effect. If a result requires a saving throw, the DC is 15. The tile vanishes after it displays a rune, but the bag never runs out of tiles.\n  Once used, the bag shouldn’t be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, the DC of the Wisdom check increases by 5 for each tile drawn after the first. You can be affected by more than one rune’s effect at a time.\n  Unless otherwise noted, each rune’s effect lasts until you finish a long rest.\n\n ***Upright Runestone*** \n\n| d12  | Rune     | Meaning       | Effect |\n|------|----------|---------------|--------|\n| 1    | Ansuz    | Truth         | When this rune appears, a zone of truth spell is triggered, centered on you, and it moves with you for 1 hour. |\n| 2    | Naudiz   | Necessity     | You have advantage on the next saving throw you make before this effect ends. |\n| 3    | Hagalaz  | Winter        | You can cast the ice storm spell once before this effect ends. |\n| 4    | Laukaz   | Sea           | You can breathe air and water for 5 hours. |\n| 5    | Algiz    | Protection    | You gain a +2 bonus to AC. |\n| 6    | Mannaz   | Teamwork      | You and up to five creatures of your choice that you can see gain 10 temporary hit points. |\n| 7    | Isaz     | Ice           | When you hit with an attack, the attack deals an extra 1d6 cold damage. |\n| 8    | Berkanan | Bear Maiden   | You can use an action to cast polymorph on yourself, transforming into a brown bear.
