{"slug":"gritless-grease","name":"Gritless Grease","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This small, metal jar, 3 inches in diameter, holds 1d4 + 1 doses of a pungent waxy oil. As an action, one dose can be applied to or swallowed by a clockwork creature or device. The clockwork creature or device ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed for 8 hours. As an action, the clockwork creature, or a creature holding a clockwork device, can gain the effect of the haste spell until the end of its next turn (no concentration required). The effects of the haste spell melt the grease, ending all its effects at the end of the spell's duration.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
