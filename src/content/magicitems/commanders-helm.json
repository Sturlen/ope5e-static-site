    "desc": "This helmet sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The type of light given off by the helm depends on the aesthetic desired by its creator. Some are surrounded in a wreath of hellish (though illusory) flames, while others give off a soft, warm halo of white or golden light. You can use an action to start or stop the light. While wearing the helm, you can use an action to make your voice loud enough to be heard clearly by anyone within 300 feet of you until the end of your next turn.",
