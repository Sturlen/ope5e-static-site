{"slug":"ice-riders-a5e","name":"Ice Riders","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"The magic focused in the soles of these boots enable you to traverse ice and snow as if it were solid, non-slippery ground. You ignore _difficult terrain_  created by cold conditions.\n\nWhen traveling over snow, you leave only 1/2-inch deep footprints, enabling you to walk over deep drifts without the dangers of falling in. Similarly, you can step onto a floating chunk of ice without fear of tipping it over, although jumping onto the ice will “push” it in the direction of the jump.","rarity":"Uncommon","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
