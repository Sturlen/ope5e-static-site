You can use the scales as a melee weapon while wearing the armor. You have proficiency with the scales and deal 1d4 slashing damage on a hit (your Strength modifier applies to the attack and damage rolls as normal). Swarms don't have resistance to the damage dealt by the scales. In addition, if a swarm occupies your space, you can attack with the scales as a bonus action.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
