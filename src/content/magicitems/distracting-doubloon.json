{"slug":"distracting-doubloon","name":"Distracting Doubloon","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This gold coin is plain and matches the dominant coin of the region. Typically, 2d6 distracting doubloons are found together. You can use an action to toss the coin up to 20 feet. The coin bursts into a flash of golden light on impact. Each creature within a 15-foot radius of where the coin landed must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature or object other than the coin for 1 minute. If an affected creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. At the end of the duration, the coin crumbles to dust and is destroyed.","rarity":"common","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
