    "desc": "12 lbs.  \n  \nThese large wings of feathers and wax are attached to a leather harness, and though the design at first seems simple there is a remarkable beauty to its complex craftsmanshipâ€”there must be very few like it elsewhere in the world, if any at all. While you are wearing these wings, you can grasp at handles in the plumage and spend an action rapidly fluttering your arms to gain a fly speed of 30 feet until the start of your next turn. You cannot wield weapons, hold a shield, or cast spells while grasping the handles. When you need to maneuver while using the wings to fly, you make either Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Dexterity air vehicle checks.\n\nThe wings have AC 13, 15 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage. After 3d4 rounds of being exposed to direct sunlight and extreme heat at the same time, the wax holding the feathers together melts and the wings are destroyed.",
