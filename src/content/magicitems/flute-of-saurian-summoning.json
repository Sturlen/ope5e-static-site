You must be proficient with wind instruments to use this flute. You can use an action to play the flute and conjure dinosaurs. This works like the conjure animals spell, except the animals you conjure must be dinosaurs or Medium or larger lizards. The dinosaurs remain for 1 hour, until they die, or until you dismiss them as a bonus action.
