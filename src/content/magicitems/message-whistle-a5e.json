    "desc": "Carved by _satyr_  musicians, this wooden whistle resembles a shushing finger when held to one’s mouth, and blowing through it does not produce an audible sound. Puffing on the whistle as an action allows you to cast the __message_ cantrip once without any other spell components. This ability recharges after one week.\n\nAlternatively, you can use an action to blow extremely hard through the whistle to cast the __sending_ spell without seen, vocal, or material components. Unlike the spell, your message can only contain 10 words and there is a 10% chance the message doesn’t arrive (even if you are on the same plane of existence). The whistle is destroyed in a burst of sparkles.",
