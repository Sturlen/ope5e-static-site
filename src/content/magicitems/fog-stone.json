{"slug":"fog-stone","name":"Fog Stone","type":"Ammunition","desc":"This sling stone is carved to look like a fluffy cloud. Typically, 1d4 + 1 fog stones are found together. When you fire the stone from a sling, it transforms into a miniature cloud as it flies through the air, and it creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on the target or point of impact. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 10 minutes or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
