{"slug":"gremlins-paw","name":"Gremlin's Paw","type":"Wand","desc":"This wand is fashioned from the fossilized forearm and claw of a gremlin. The wand has 5 charges. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 15): bane (1 charge), bestow curse (3 charges), or hideous laughter (1 charge). The wand regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become afflicted with short-term madness. On a 1, the rod crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
