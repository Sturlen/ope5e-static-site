{"slug":"deaths-mirror","name":"Death's Mirror","type":"Ring","desc":"Made from woven lead and silver, this ring fits only on the hand's smallest finger. As the moon is a dull reflection of the sun's glory, so too is the power within this ring merely an imitation of the healing energies that can bestow true life. The ring has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to gain 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
