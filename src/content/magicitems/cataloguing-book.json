{"slug":"cataloguing-book","name":"Cataloguing Book","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This nondescript book contains statistics and details on various objects. Libraries often use these tomes to assist visitors in finding the knowledge contained within their stacks. You can use an action to touch the book to an object you wish to catalogue. The book inscribes the object's name, provided by you, on one of its pages and sketches a rough illustration to accompany the object's name. If the object is a magic item or otherwise magic-imbued, the book also inscribes the object's properties. The book becomes magically connected to the object, and its pages denote the object's current location, provided the object is not protected by nondetection or other magic that thwarts divination magic. When you attune to this book, its previously catalogued contents disappear.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"}
