{"slug":"security-gremlin-a5e","name":"Security Gremlin","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"This military-styled tin contains a Tiny ethereal mottled green goblinoid dressed in soldierâ€™s armor and when opened it salutes with earnest eagerness. You can instruct this gremlin to patrol an area, such as the perimeter of a room, campsite, or structure, while keeping watch for a creature type you instruct it to watch for. It completely ignores any creatures that are not of the chosen creature type. If it spots a creature of the chosen type, it immediately begins shouting loud enough to be heard within 30 feet as it runs back into its tin to hide.","rarity":"Common","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
