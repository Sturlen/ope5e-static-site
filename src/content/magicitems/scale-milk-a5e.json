{"slug":"scale-milk-a5e","name":"Scale MIlk","type":"Potion","desc":"Contained in a small, clear bottle, the cap to this item is carefully sealed with thick wax. The gray tinge to the milky liquid and the aroma of putrid fruit once it is opened are off-putting, but if it has not spoiled scale milk is a powerful restorative.\n\nIf consumed within 1 hour of breaking the wax seal, you receive the benefits of both the _greater restoration_  and __heal_  spells.\n\nIf you consume this potion after the first hour, make a DC 18 Constitution _saving throw_ . On a failure you take 6d8 poison damage and are _poisoned_  for the next hour. On a success you take half damage and are poisoned until the end of their next turn.
