    "desc": "These obsidian shards are engraved with words in Deep Speech, and their presence disquiets non-evil, intelligent creatures. The writing on the shards is obscure, esoteric, and possibly incomplete. The shards have 10 charges and give you access to a powerful array of Void magic spells. While holding the shards, you use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from them, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: living shadows* (5 charges), maddening whispers* (2 charges), or void strike* (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the crushing curse* spell from the shards without using any charges. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) can be found in Deep Magic for 5th Edition. At the GM's discretion, spells from Deep Magic for 5th Edition can be replaced with other spells of similar levels and similarly related to darkness or madness. The shards regain 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk. Each time you use the ebon shards to cast a spell, you must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage.",
