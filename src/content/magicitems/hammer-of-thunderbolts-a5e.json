This weapon can only be attuned to when you are wearing a __belt of giant strength_ and __gauntlets of ogre power ._ The attunement ends if you remove or change attunement away from either of those items. \n\nWhile you are attuned to this weapon and holding it:\n\n* Your Strength score increases by 4 (and can exceed 20, but not 30).\n* When you make an attack roll with this weapon against a giant and roll a natural 20, the giant makes a DC 17 Constitution _saving throw_  or dies.\n\nYou can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the maul with a normal range of 20 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet. On a hit, the maul unleashes a thunderclap heard from up to 300 feet away. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it make a DC 17 Constitution _saving throw_  or become _stunned_  until the end of your next turn.\n\n  \nThe maul has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 charges each dawn.",
