    "desc": "This bullseye lantern sheds light as normal when a lit candle is placed inside of it. If the light shines on meat, no matter how toxic or rotten, for at least 10 minutes, the meat is rendered safe to eat. The lantern's magic doesn't improve the meat's flavor, but the light does restore the meat's nutritional value and purify it, rendering it free of poison and disease. In addition, when an undead creature ends its turn in the light, it takes 1 radiant damage.",
