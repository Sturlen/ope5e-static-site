{"slug":"barrow-bread-a5e","name":"Barrow Bread","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"Barrow bread is made from mashing together plantains and starches that are grown in the tropical barrows. While this viscous, starchy paste is not actually a bread, it perfectly preserves and maintains the temperature of any food tucked inside it for up to a week, protecting and preserving 1 Supply. The magic is contained in the plantain leaves that are wrapped around the barrow bread. Once unwrapped, the barrow bread itself can be consumed (as 1 Supply) within 15 minutes before the outside elements spoil it.
