    "desc": "This cloak is an unassuming neutral grayish-brown color that seems to slowly fade into the background whenever you are standing still. You cannot attune to this cloak if you are not proficient with Survival. \n\nWhile attuned to and wearing the cloak, you may treat a _long rest_  as if you were in a _haven_ . Once you use this property, you cannot do so again for 1 week. \n\nIn addition, the cloak allows you to travel at a fast pace while remaining stealthy.",
