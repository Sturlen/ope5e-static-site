    "desc": "This small, square wooden box is carved with scenes of life in a busy city. Inside, the box is divided into six compartments, each holding a different magical spice. A small wooden spoon is also stored inside the box for measuring. A spice box of zest contains six spoonfuls of each spice when full. You can add one spoonful of a single spice per person to a meal that you or someone else is cooking. The magic of the spices is nullified if you add two or more spices together. If a creature consumes a meal cooked with a spice, it gains a benefit based on the spice used in the meal. The effects last for 1 hour unless otherwise noted.",
