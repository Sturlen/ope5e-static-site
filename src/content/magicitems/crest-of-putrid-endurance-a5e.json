While you wear it, you regain hit points equal to your level at the start of each of your turns so long as you have at least 1 hit point. As a bonus action, you can draw greater power from the crest. For the next minute, its healing factor is doubled and you read as an undead for the purposes of any effect that would identify your creature type. You canâ€™t use this effect again until the next dawn.\n\n_**Curse.**_ You cannot benefit from magical healing.","rarity":"Uncommon","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
