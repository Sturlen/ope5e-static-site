In addition, if you are poisoned, this potion neutralizes the poison. Known for its powerful, somewhat burning smell, this potion is difficult to drink, requiring a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw to drink it. On a failure, you are poisoned for 10 minutes and don't gain the benefits of the potion.",
