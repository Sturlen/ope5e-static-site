Any key can be inserted into a keyhole.\n\nIf you are trained in the Arcana or Engineering skill, you can use an action to cause a lock within 500 miles to magically lock or unlock by inserting the lock’s key into the clock and adjusting the clock’s mechanisms. Additionally, so long as the key remains in the clock, you can schedule the lock to lock or unlock at certain hours of the day.",
