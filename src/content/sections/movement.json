{"slug":"movement","name":"Movement","desc":"Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope---all sorts of movement play a keyrole in fantasy gaming adventures.\n\nThe GM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exactdistances or travel times: You travel through the forest and find thedungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day. Even in adungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM cansummarize movement between encounters: After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map,which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged bya narrow stone arch. Sometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get fromone spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes.\n\nThe rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speedand travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're movingover.\n\n## Speed\n\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feetthat the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumesshort bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threateningsituation.\n\nThe following rules determine how far a character or monster can move ina minute, an hour, or a day.\n\n### Travel Pace\n\nWhile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, orslow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how farthe party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has anyeffect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pacemakes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\n\n**Forced March.** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travelfor 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\n\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters coverthe distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each charactermust make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a charactersuffers one level of exhaustion.\n\n**Mounts and Vehicles.** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fastpace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters cancover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except indensely populated areas.\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace asnormal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed ofthe vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gainbenefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of thecrew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or specialvehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly.\n\n### Difficult Terrain\n\nThe travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relativelysimple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground---all considered difficult terrain.\n\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain---moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed---so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\n\n## Special Types of Movement\n\nMovement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim,or jump to get where they need to go.\n\n### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling\n\nWhile climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing orswimming speed. At the GM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surfaceor one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require asuccessful Strength (Athletics) check.\n\n### Jumping\n\nYour Strength determines how far you can jump.\n\n**Long Jump.** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet upto your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediatelybefore the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap onlyhalf that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs afoot of movement.\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as ajump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed ona DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no tallerthan a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall.\nOtherwise, you hit it.\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you landprone.\n\n**High Jump.** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a numberof feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feeton foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump,you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear onthe jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM mightallow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than younormally can.\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourself during thejump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height ofthe jump plus 1Â½ times your height.","document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"5e Core Rules","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd","parent":"Gameplay Mechanics"}
