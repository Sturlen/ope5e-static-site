    "desc": "A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.\n\n**Tools (table)**\n\n| Item                      | Cost  | Weight |\n|---------------------------|-------|--------|\n| **_Artisan's tools_**     |       |        |\n| - Alchemist's supplies    | 50 gp | 8 lb.  |\n| - Brewer's supplies       | 20 gp | 9 lb.  |\n| - Calligrapher's supplies | 10 gp | 5 lb.  |\n| - Carpenter's tools       | 8 gp  | 6 lb.  |\n| - Cartographer's tools    | 15 gp | 6 lb.  |\n| - Cobbler's tools         | 5 gp  | 5 lb.  |\n| - Cook's utensils         | 1 gp  | 8 lb.  |\n| - Glassblower's tools     | 30 gp | 5 lb.  |\n| - Jeweler's tools         | 25 gp | 2 lb.  |\n| - Leatherworker's tools   | 5 gp  | 5 lb.  |\n| - Mason's tools           | 10 gp | 8 lb.  |\n| - Painter's supplies      | 10 gp | 5 lb.  |\n| - Potter's tools          | 10 gp | 3 lb.  |\n| - Smith's tools           | 20 gp | 8 lb.  |\n| - Tinker's tools          | 50 gp | 10 lb. |\n| - Weaver's tools          | 1 gp  | 5 lb.  |\n| - Woodcarver's tools      | 1 gp  | 5 lb.  |\n| Disguise kit              | 25 gp | 3 lb.  |\n| Forgery kit               | 15 gp | 5 lb.  |\n| **_Gaming set_**          |       |        |\n| - Dice set                | 1 sp  | -      |\n| - Playing card set        | 5 sp  | -      |\n| Herbalism kit             | 5 gp  | 3 lb.  |\n| **_Musical instrument_**  |       |        |\n| - Bagpipes                | 30 gp | 6 lb.  |\n| - Drum                    | 6 gp  | 3 lb.  |\n| - Dulcimer                | 25 gp | 10 lb. |\n| - Flute                   | 2 gp  | 1 lb.  |\n| - Lute                    | 35 gp | 2 lb.  |\n| - Lyre                    | 30 gp | 2 lb.  |\n| - Horn                    | 3 gp  | 2 lb.  |\n| - Pan flute               | 12 gp | 2 lb.  |\n| - Shawm                   | 2 gp  | 1 lb.  |\n| - Viol                    | 30 gp | 1 lb.  |\n| Navigator's tools         | 25 gp | 2 lb.  |\n| Poisoner's kit            | 50 gp | 2 lb.  |\n| Thieves' tools            | 25 gp | 1 lb.  |\n| Vehicles (land or water)  | \\*    | \\*     |\n\n\\* See the “Mounts and Vehicles” section.\n\n**_Artisan's Tools._** These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade.
