Similar to Druidic and Thieves' Cant, Floriography is a secret language often used to communicate subtle ideas, symbolic meaning, and even basic messages. Floriography is conveyed through the combinations of colors, styles, and even types of flowers in bouquets, floral arrangements, and floral illustrations, often with a gift-giving component.",
