    "desc": "Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that donâ€™t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as _demiplane_, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a _plane shift_ spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The _gate_ spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.",
