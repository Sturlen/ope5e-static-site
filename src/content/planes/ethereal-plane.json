{"slug":"ethereal-plane","name":"Ethereal Plane","desc":"The **Ethereal Plane** is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the _see invisibility_ and _true seeing_ spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as _forcecage_ and _wall of force_. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.","document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"5e Core Rules","document__url":"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd","parent":"Transitive Planes"}
