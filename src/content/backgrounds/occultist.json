{"name":"Occultist","desc":"At your core, you are a believer in things others dismiss. The signs abound if you know where to look. Questions beget answers that spur further questions. The cycle is endless as you uncover layer after layer of mystery and secrets.\n  Piercing the veil hiding beyond the surface of reality is an irresistible lure spurring you to delve into forgotten and dangerous places in the world. Perhaps you've always yearned toward the occult, or it could be that you encountered something or someone who opened your eyes to the possibilities. You may belong to some esoteric organization determined to uncover the mystery, a cult bent on using the secrets for a dark purpose, or you may be searching for answers on your own. As an occultist, you ask the questions reality doesn't want to answer.","slug":"occultist","skill_proficiencies":"Arcana, Religion","tool_proficiencies":"Thieves' tools","languages":"Two of your choice","equipment":"A book of obscure lore holding clues to an occult location, a bottle of black ink, a quill, a leather-bound journal in which you record your secrets, a bullseye lantern, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp","feature":"Strange Lore","feature_desc":"Your passions for forbidden knowledge, esoteric religions, secretive cults, and terrible histories brought you into contact with a wide variety of interesting and unique individuals operating on the fringes of polite society. When you're trying to find something that pertains to eldritch secrets or dark knowledge, you have a good idea of where to start looking. Usually, this information comes from information brokers, disgraced scholars, chaotic mages, dangerous cults, or insane priests. Your GM might rule that the knowledge you seek isn't found with just one contact, but this feature provides a starting point.","suggested_characteristics":"Occultists can't resist the lure of an ancient ruin, forgotten dungeon, or the lair of some mysterious cult. They eagerly follow odd rumors, folktales, and obscure clues found in dusty tomes. Some adventure with the hope of turning their discoveries into fame and fortune, while others consider the answers they uncover to be the true reward. Whatever their motivations, occultists combine elements of archaeologist, scholar, and fanatic.\n\n| d8 | Personality Trait                                                                             |\n|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | I always ask questions, especially if I think I can learn something new.                      |\n| 2  | I believe every superstition I hear and follow their rules fanatically.                       |\n| 3  | The things I know give me nightmares, and not only when I sleep.                              |\n| 4  | Nothing makes me happier than explaining some obscure lore to my friends.                     |\n| 5  | I startle easily.                                                                             |\n| 6  | I perform a host of rituals throughout the day that I believe protect me from occult threats. |\n| 7  | I never know when to give up.                                                                 |\n| 8  | The more someone refuses to believe me, the more I am determined to convince them.            |\n\n| d6 | Ideal                                                                                             |\n|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | **Domination.** With the power I will unearth, I will take my revenge on those who wronged me.
