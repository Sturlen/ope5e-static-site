    "name": "Former Adventurer",
    "desc": "As you belted on your weapons and hoisted the pack onto your back, you never thought you'd become an adventurer again. But the heroic call couldn't be ignored. You've tried this once before—perhaps it showered you in wealth and glory or perhaps it ended with sorrow and regret. No one ever said adventuring came with a guarantee of success.\n  Now, the time has come to set off toward danger once again. The reasons for picking up adventuring again vary. Could it be a calamitous threat to the town? The region? The world? Was the settled life not what you expected? Or did your past finally catch up to you? In the end, all that matters is diving back into danger. And it's time to show these new folks how it's done.\n\n***Reason for Retirement***\nGiving up your first adventuring career was a turning point in your life. Triumph or tragedy, the reason why you gave it up might still haunt you and may shape your actions as you reenter the adventuring life. Choose the event that led you to stop adventuring or roll a d12 and consult the table below.\n\n| d12  | Event                                                                                                      |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1    | Your love perished on one of your adventures, and you quit in despair.                                     |\n| 2    | You were the only survivor after an ambush by a hideous beast.                                             |\n| 3    | Legal entanglements forced you to quit, and they may cause you trouble again.                              |\n| 4    | A death in the family required you to return home.                                                         |\n| 5    | Your old group disowned you for some reason.                                                               |\n| 6    | A fabulous treasure allowed you to have a life of luxury, until the money ran out.                         |\n| 7    | An injury forced you to give up adventuring.                                                               |\n| 8    | You suffered a curse which doomed your former group, but the curse has finally faded away.                 |\n| 9    | You rescued a young child or creature and promised to care for them. They have since grown up and left.    |\n| 10   | You couldn't master your fear and fled from a dangerous encounter, never to return.                        |\n| 11   | As a reward for helping an area, you were offered a position with the local authorities, and you accepted. |\n| 12   | You killed or defeated your nemesis. Now they are back, and you must finish the job.                       |",

    "feature_desc": "Your previous career as an adventurer might have been brief or long. Either way, you certainly journeyed far and met people along the way. Some of these acquaintances might remember you fondly for aiding them in their time of need. On the other hand, others may be suspicious, or even hostile, because of your past actions. When you least expect it, or maybe just when you need it, you might encounter someone who knows you from your previous adventuring career. These people work in places high and low, their fortunes varying widely. The individual responds appropriately based on your mutual history, helping or hindering you at the GM's discretion.",
    "suggested_characteristics": "Former adventurers bring a level of practical experience that fledgling heroes can't match. However, the decisions, outcomes, successes, and failures of your previous career often weigh heavily on your mind. The past seldom remains in the past. How you rise to these new (or old) challenges determines the outcome of your new career.\n\n| d8 | Personality Trait                                                               |\n|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | I have a thousand stories about every aspect of the adventuring life.           |\n| 2  | My past is my own, and to the pit with anyone who pushes me about it.           |\n| 3  | I can endure any hardship without complaint.                                    |\n| 4  | I have a list of rules for surviving adventures, and I refer to them often.     |\n| 5  | It's a dangerous job, and I take my pleasures when I can.                       |\n| 6  | I can't help mentioning all the famous friends I've met before.                 |\n| 7  | Anyone who doesn't recognize me is clearly not someone worth knowing.           |\n| 8  | I've seen it all.
