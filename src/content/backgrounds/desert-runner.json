{"name":"Desert Runner","desc":"You grew up in the desert. As a nomad, you moved from place to place, following the caravan trails. Your upbringing makes you more than just accustomed to desert living—you thrive there. Your family has lived in the desert for centuries, and you know more about desert survival than life in the towns and cities.","slug":"desert-runner","skill_proficiencies":"Perception, Survival","tool_proficiencies":"Herbalist kit","languages":"One of your choice","equipment":"Traveler's clothes, herbalist kit, waterskin, pouch with 10 gp","feature":"Nomad","feature_desc":"Living in the open desert has allowed your body to adapt to a range of environmental conditions. You can survive on 1 gallon of water in hot conditions (or 1/2 gallon in normal conditions) without being forced to make Constitution saving throws, and you are considered naturally adapted to hot climates. While in a desert, you can read the environment to predict natural weather patterns and temperatures for the next 24 hours, allowing you to cross dangerous terrain at the best times. The accuracy of your predictions is up to the GM, but they should be reliable unless affected by magic or unforeseeable events, such as distant earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.","suggested_characteristics":"Those raised in the desert can be the friendliest of humanoids—knowing allies are better than enemies in that harsh environment—or territorial and warlike, believing that protecting food and water sources by force is the only way to survive.\n\n| d8 | Personality Trait |\n|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | I'm much happier sleeping under the stars than in a bed in a stuffy caravanserai.          |\n| 2  | It's always best to help a traveler in need; one day it might be you.                      |\n| 3  | I am slow to trust strangers, but I'm extremely loyal to my friends.                       |\n| 4  | If there's a camel race, I'm the first to saddle up!                                       |\n| 5  | I always have a tale or poem to share at the campfire.                                     |\n| 6  | I don't like sleeping in the same place more than two nights in a row.                     |\n| 7  | I've been troubled by dreams for the last month.
