{"name":"Gamekeeper","desc":"You are at home in natural environments, chasing prey or directing less skilled hunters in the best ways to track game through the brush. You know the requirements for encouraging a herd to grow, and you know what sustainable harvesting from a herd involves. You can train a hunting beast to recognize an owner and perform a half-dozen commands, given the time. You also know the etiquette for engaging nobility or other members of the upper classes, as they regularly seek your services, and you can carry yourself in a professional manner in such social circles.","slug":"gamekeeper","skill_proficiencies":"Animal Handling, Persuasion","tool_proficiencies":"Leatherworker's tools","languages":"One of your choice","equipment":"A set of leatherworker's tools, a hunting trap, fishing tackle, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp","feature":"Confirmed Guildmember","feature_desc":"As a recognized member of the Gamekeepers' Guild, you are knowledgeable in the care, training, and habits of animals used for hunting. With 30 days' of work and at least 2 gp for each day, you can train a raptor, such as a hawk, falcon, or owl, or a hunting dog, such as a hound, terrier, or cur, to become a hunting companion. Use the statistics of an owl for the raptor and the statistics of a jackal for the hunting dog.\n  A hunting companion is trained to obey and respond to a series of one-word commands or signals, communicating basic concepts such as “attack,” “protect,” “retrieve,” “find,” “hide,” or similar. The companion can know up to six such commands and can be trained to obey a number of creatures, other than you, equal to your proficiency bonus. A hunting companion travels with you wherever you go, unless you enter a particularly dangerous environment (such as a poisonous swamp), or you command the companion to stay elsewhere. A hunting companion doesn't join you in combat and stays on the edge of any conflict until it is safe to return to your side.\n  When traveling overland with a hunting companion, you can use the companion to find sufficient food to sustain yourself and up to five other people each day. You can have only one hunting companion at a time.","suggested_characteristics":"You are one of the capable people who maintains hunting preserves, trains coursing hounds and circling raptors, and plans the safe outings that allow fair nobles, rich merchants, visiting dignitaries, and their entourages to venture into preserves and forests to seek their quarry. You are as comfortable hunting quarry in the forest as you are conversing with members of the elite who have an interest in hunting.\n\n| d8 | Personality Trait |\n|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | Nature has lessons to teach us all, and I'm always happy to share them.                                                         |\n| 2  | Once while out on a hunt, something happened which was very relatable to our current situation.
