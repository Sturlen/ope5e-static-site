{"name":"Court Servant","desc":"Even though you are independent now, you were once a servant to a merchant, noble, regent, or other person of high station. You are an expert in complex social dynamics and knowledgeable in the history and customs of courtly life. Work with your GM to determine whom you served and why you are no longer a servant: did your master or masters retire and no longer require servants, did you resign from the service of a harsh master, did the court you served fall to a neighboring empire, or did something else happen?","slug":"court-servant","skill_proficiencies":"History, Insight","tool_proficiencies":"One artisan's tools set of your choice","languages":"One of your choice","equipment":"A set of artisan's tools of your choice, a unique piece of jewelry, a set of fine clothes, a handcrafted pipe, and a belt pouch containing 20 gp","feature":"Servant's Invisibility","feature_desc":"The art of excellent service requires a balance struck between being always available and yet unobtrusive, and you've mastered it. If you don't perform a visible action, speak or be spoken to, or otherwise have attention drawn to you for at least 1 minute, creatures nearby have trouble remembering you are even in the room. Until you speak, perform a visible action, or have someone draw attention to you, creatures must succeed on a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC equal to 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus) to notice you. Otherwise, they conduct themselves as though you aren't present until either attention is drawn to you or one of their actions would take them into or within 5 feet of the space you occupy.","suggested_characteristics":"Court servants tend to be outwardly quiet and soft-spoken, but their insight into the nuances of conversation and societal happenings is unparalleled. When in crowds or around strangers, most court servants keep to themselves, quietly observing their surroundings and later sharing such observations with those they trust.\n\n        | d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                          |\n|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | Unless I must speak, I hold my breath while serving others.                                                |\n| 2  | It takes all my effort not to show the effusive emotions I feel when I help others.
