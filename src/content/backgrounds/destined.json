{"name":"Destined","desc":"Duty is a complicated, tangled affair, be it filial, political, or civil. Sometimes, there's wealth and intrigue involved, but more often than not, there's also obligation and responsibility. You are a person with just such a responsibility. This could involve a noble title, an arranged marriage, a family business you're expected to administer, or an inherited civil office. You promised to fulfill this responsibility, you are desperately trying to avoid this duty, or you might even be seeking the person intended to be at your side. Regardless of the reason, you're on the road, heading toward or away from your destiny.\n\n***Destiny***\nYou're a person who's running from something or hurtling headfirst towards something, but just what is it? The responsibility or event might be happily anticipated or simply dreaded; either way, you're committed to the path. Choose a destiny or roll a d8 and consult the table below.\n\n| d8 | Destiny                                                                                                                  |\n|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | You are running away from a marriage.                                                                                     |\n| 2  | You are seeking your runaway betrothed.                                                                                   |\n| 3  | You don't want to take over your famous family business.                                                                  |\n| 4  | You need to arrive at a religious site at a specific time to complete an event or prophecy.                               |\n| 5  | Your noble relative died, and you're required to take their vacant position.                                              |\n| 6  | You are the reincarnation of a famous figure, and you're expected to live in an isolated temple.                          |\n| 7  | You were supposed to serve an honorary but dangerous position in your people's military.                                  |\n| 8  | Members of your family have occupied a civil office (court scribe, sheriff, census official, or similar) for generations. |","slug":"destined","skill_proficiencies":"History, Insight","tool_proficiencies":"No additional tool proficiencies","languages":"One of your choice","equipment":"A dagger, quarterstaff, or spear, a set of traveler's clothes, a memento of your destiny (a keepsake from your betrothed, the seal of your destined office, your family signet ring, or similar), a belt pouch containing 15 gp","feature":"Reputation of Opportunity","feature_desc":"Your story precedes you, as does your quest to claim—or run away from—your destiny. Those in positions of power, such as nobles, bureaucrats, rich merchants, and even mercenaries and brigands, all look to either help or hinder you, based on what they think they may get out of it. They're always willing to meet with you briefly to see just how worthwhile such aid or interference might be. This might mean a traveler pays for your passage on a ferry, a generous benefactor covers your group's meals at a tavern, or a local governor invites your adventuring entourage to enjoy a night's stay in their guest quarters. However, the aid often includes an implied threat or request. Some might consider delaying you as long as politely possible, some might consider taking you prisoner for ransom or to do “what's best” for you, and others might decide to help you on your quest in exchange for some future assistance. You're never exactly sure of the associated “cost” of the person's aid until the moment arrives. In the meantime, the open road awaits.","suggested_characteristics":"Destined characters might be running toward or away from destiny, but whatever the case, their destiny has shaped them. Think about the impact of your destiny on you and the kind of relationship you have with your destiny. Do you embrace it? Accept it as inevitable?
