{"name":"Mysterious Origins","desc":"Your origins are a mystery even to you. You might recall fragments of your previous life, or you might dream of events that could be memories, but you can't be sure of what is remembered and what is imagined. You recall practical information and facts about the world and perhaps even your name, but your upbringing and life before you lost your memories now exist only in dreams or sudden flashes of familiarity.\n  You can leave the details of your character's past up to your GM or give the GM a specific backstory that your character can't remember. Were you the victim of a spell gone awry, or did you voluntarily sacrifice your memories in exchange for power? Is your amnesia the result of a natural accident, or did you purposefully have your mind wiped in order to forget a memory you couldn't live with? Perhaps you have family or friends that are searching for you or enemies you can't even remember.","slug":"mysterious-origins","skill_proficiencies":"Deception, Survival","tool_proficiencies":"One type of artisan's tools or one type of musical instrument","languages":"One of your choice","equipment":"A mysterious trinket from your past life, a set of artisan's tools or a musical instrument (one of your choice), a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp","feature":"Unexpected Acquaintance","feature_desc":"Even though you can't recall them, someone from your past will recognize you and offer to aid you—or to impede you. The person and their relationship to you depend on the truth of your backstory. They might be a childhood friend, a former rival, or even your child who's grown up with dreams of finding their missing parent. They may want you to return to your former life even if it means abandoning your current goals and companions. Work with your GM to determine the details of this character and your history with them.","suggested_characteristics":"You may be bothered by your lack of memories and driven to recover them or reclaim the secrets of your past, or you can use your anonymity to your advantage.\n\n| d8 | Personality Trait                                                              |\n|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | I'm always humming a song, but I can't remember the words.                     |\n| 2  | I love learning new things and meeting new people.                             |\n| 3  | I want to prove my worth and have people know my name.                         |\n| 4  | I don't like places that are crowded or noisy.                                 |\n| 5  | I'm mistrustful of mages and magic in general.                                 |\n| 6  | I like to keep everything tidy and organized so that I can find things easily. |\n| 7  | Every night I record my day in a detailed journal.                             |\n| 8  | I live in the present.
