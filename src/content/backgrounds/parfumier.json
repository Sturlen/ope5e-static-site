    "name": "Parfumier",
    "desc": "You are educated and ambitious. You spent your youth apprenticed among a city's more reputable greenhouses, laboratories, and perfumeries. There, you studied botany and chemistry and explored properties and interactions with fine crystal, rare metals, and magic. You quickly mastered the skills to identify and process rare and complex botanical and alchemical samples and the proper extractions and infusions of essential oils, pollens, and other fragrant chemical compounds—natural or otherwise.\n  Not all (dramatic) changes to one's lifestyle, calling, or ambitions are a result of social or financial decline. Some are simply decided upon. Regardless of your motivation or incentive for change, you have accepted that a comfortable life of research, science and business is—at least for now—a part of your past.",

    "feature_desc": "Before you became an adventurer, you crafted perfumes for customers in your home town or city. When not out adventuring, you can fall back on that trade to make a living. For each week you spend practicing your profession, you can craft one of the following at half the normal cost in time and resources: 5 samples of fine perfume worth 10 gp each, 2 vials of acid, or 1 vial of parfum toxique worth 50 gp. As an action, you can throw a vial of parfum toxique up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the parfum as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn.",
    "suggested_characteristics": "As with many parfumiers with the extensive training you received, you are well spoken, stately of bearing, and possessed of a self-assuredness that sometimes is found imposing. You are not easily impressed and rarely subscribe to notions like “insurmountable” or “unavoidable.” Every problem has a solution.\n\n| d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                                                       |\n|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | I do not deal in absolutes.
