{"name":"Sentry","desc":"In your youth, the defense of the city, the community, the caravan, or your patron was how you earned your coin. You might have been trained by an old, grizzled city watchman, or you might have been pressed into service by the local magistrate for your superior skills, size, or intellect. However you came to the role, you excelled at defending others.\n  You have a nose for trouble, a keen eye for spotting threats, a strong arm to back it up, and you are canny enough to know when to act. Most importantly, though, you were a peace officer or a protector and not a member of an army which might march to war.\n\n***Specialization***\nEach person or location that hires a sentry comes with its own set of unique needs and responsibilities. As a sentry, you fulfilled one of these unique roles. Choose a specialization or roll a d6 and consult the table below to define your expertise as a sentry.\n\n| d6 | Specialization                 |\n|----|--------------------------------|\n| 1  | City or gate watch             |\n| 2  | Bodyguard or jailor            |\n| 3  | Caravan guard                  |\n| 4  | Palace or judicial sentry      |\n| 5  | Shop guard                     |\n| 6  | Ecclesiastical or temple guard |","slug":"sentry","skill_proficiencies":"Insight, Perception","tool_proficiencies":"One type of gaming set","languages":"One language of your choice","equipment":"A set of dice or deck of cards, a shield bearing your previous employer's symbol, a set of common clothes, a hooded lantern, a signal whistle, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp","feature":"Comrades in Arms","feature_desc":"The knowing look from the caravan guard to the city gatekeeper or the nod of recognition between the noble's bodyguard and the district watchmanâ€”no matter the community, city, or town, the guards share a commonality of purpose. When you arrive in a new location, you can speak briefly with the gate guards, local watch, or other community guardians to gain local knowledge. This knowledge could be information, such as the most efficient routes through the city, primary vendors for a variety of luxury goods, the best (or worst) inns and taverns, the primary criminal elements in town, or the current conflicts in the community.","suggested_characteristics":"You're a person who understands both patience and boredom, as a guard is always waiting for something to happen. More often than not, sentries hope nothing happens because something happening usually means something has gone wrong. A life spent watching and protecting, acting in critical moments, and learning the details of places and behaviors; all of these help shape the personality of the former sentry. Some claim you never stop being a guard, you just change what you protect.\n\n| d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                      |\n|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | I've seen the dregs of society and nothing surprises me anymore.                                                       |\n| 2  | I know where to look to spot threats lurking around a corner, in a glance, and even in a bite of food or cup of drink. |\n| 3  | I hate standing still and always keep moving.                                                                          |\n| 4  | My friends know they can rely on me to stand and protect them.                                                         |\n| 5  | I resent the rich and powerful; they think they can get away with anything.                                            |\n| 6  | A deception of any sort marks you as untrustworthy in my mind.                                                         |\n| 7  | Stopping lawbreakers taught me the best ways to skirt the law.                                                         |\n| 8  | I never take anything at face-value.                                                                                   |\n\n| d6 | Ideal                                                                                      |\n|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | **Greed.** Threats to my companions only increase my glory when I protect them from it.
