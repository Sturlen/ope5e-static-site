{"slug":"spike-growth","name":"Spike Growth","desc":"The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. The development of land is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that does not see the area when the spell is spell casts must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.","higher_level":"","page":"phb 277","range":"150 feet","target_range_sort":150,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"Seven sharp spines or seven twigs cut peak.","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 10 minutes","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"2nd-level","level_int":2,"spell_level":2,"school":"Transmutation","dnd_class":"Cleric, Druid, Ranger","spell_lists":["cleric","druid","ranger"],"archetype":"Cleric: Nature","circles":"Arctic, Mountain","document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"5e Core Rules","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"}
