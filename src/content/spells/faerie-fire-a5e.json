Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined unless it makes a Dexterity saving throw. Until the spell ends, affected objects and creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.\n\nAny attack roll against an affected object or creature has advantage. The spell also negates the benefits of invisibility on affected creatures and objects.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"60 feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"V","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":false,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"1st-level","level_int":1,"spell_level":1,"school":"Evocation","dnd_class":"Bard, Druid","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
