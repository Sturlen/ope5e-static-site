    "desc": "You touch a nonmagical pipe or horn instrument and imbue it with magic that lures creatures toward it. Each creature that enters or starts its turn within 150 feet of the affected object must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 10 minutes. A creature charmed by this spell must take the Dash action and move toward the affected object by the safest available route on each of its turns. Once a charmed creature moves within 5 feet of the object, it is also incapacitated as it stares at the object and sways in place to a mesmerizing tune only it can hear. If the object is moved, the charmed creature attempts to follow it.\n  For every 10 minutes that elapse, the creature can make a new Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on that creature. If a charmed creature is attacked, the spell ends immediately on that creature. Once a creature has been charmed by this spell, it can't be charmed by it again for 24 hours.",
