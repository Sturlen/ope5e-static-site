    "desc": "Deep Magic: clockwork You imbue a spell of 1st thru 3rd level that has a casting time of instantaneous onto a gear worth 100 gp per level of spell you are imbuing. At the end of the ritual, the gear is placed into a piece of clockwork that includes a timer or trigger mechanism. When the timer or trigger goes off, the spell is cast. If the range of the spell was Touch, it effects only a target touching the device. If the spell had a range in feet, the spell is cast on the closest viable target within range, based on the nature of the spell. Spells with a range of Self or Sight can't be imbued. If the gear is placed with a timer, it activates when the time elapses regardless of whether a legitimate target is available.",
