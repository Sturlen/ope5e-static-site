{"slug":"grudge-match","name":"Grudge Match","desc":"This spell affects any creatures you designate within range, as long as the group contains an equal number of allies and enemies. If the number of allies and enemies targeted isnâ€™t the same, the spell fails. For the duration of the spell, each target gains a +2 bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls made involving other targets of the spell. All affected creatures can identify fellow targets of the spell by sight. If an affected creature makes any of the above rolls against a non-target, it takes a -2 penalty on that roll.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases by 1 round for each slot level above 2nd.","page":"","range":"100 feet","target_range_sort":100,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"1 round","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"2nd-level","level_int":2,"spell_level":2,"school":"evocation","dnd_class":"Ranger, Warlock","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
