    "desc": "You temporarily halt the fall of up to a 10-foot cube of nonmagical objects or debris, saving those who might have been crushed. The falling material's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round and comes to a stop 5 feet above the ground, where it hovers until the spell ends. This spell can't prevent missile weapons from striking a target, and it can't slow the descent of an object larger than a 10-foot cube. However, at the GM's discretion, it can slow the descent of a section of a larger object, such as the wall of a falling building or a section of sail and rigging tied to a falling mast.",
