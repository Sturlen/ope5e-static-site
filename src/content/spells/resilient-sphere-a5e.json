{"slug":"resilient-sphere-a5e","name":"Resilient Sphere","desc":"A transparent sphere of force encloses the target.\n\nThe sphere is weightless and just large enough for the target to fit inside. The sphere can be destroyed without harming anyone inside by being dealt at least 15 force damage at once or by being targeted with a dispel magic spell cast using a 4th-level or higher spell slot. The sphere is immune to all other damage, and no spell effects, physical objects, or anything else can pass through, though a target can breathe while inside it. The target cannot be damaged by any attacks or effects originating from outside the sphere, and the target cannot damage anything outside of it.\n\nThe target can use an action to roll the sphere at half its Speed. Similarly, the sphere can be picked up and moved by other creatures.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"30 feet","target_range_sort":30,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"4th-level","level_int":4,"spell_level":4,"school":"Evocation","dnd_class":"Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
