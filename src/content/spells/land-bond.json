    "desc": "You touch a willing creature and infuse it with ley energy, creating a bond between the creature and the land. For the duration of the spell, if the target is in contact with the ground, the target has advantage on saving throws and ability checks made to avoid being moved or knocked prone against its will. Additionally, the creature ignores nonmagical difficult terrain and is immune to effects from extreme environments such as heat, cold (but not cold or fire damage), and altitude.",
