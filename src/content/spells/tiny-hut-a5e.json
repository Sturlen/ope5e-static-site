    "desc": "You create an immobile dome of protective force that provides shelter and can be used as a safe haven (Chapter 4: Exploration in Trials & Treasures). The dome is of a color of your choosing, can't be seen through from the outside, is transparent on the inside, and can fit up to 10 Medium creatures (including you) within.\n\nThe dome prevents inclement weather and environmental effects from passing through it, though creatures and objects may pass through freely. Spells and other magical effects can't cross the dome in either direction, and the dome provides a comfortable dry interior no matter the conditions outside of it. You can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark at any time on your turn.\n\nThe spell fails if a Large creature or more than 10 creatures are inside the dome. The spell ends when you leave the dome.",
