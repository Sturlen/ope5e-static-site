    "desc": "An area of false vision encompasses all creatures within 20 feet of you. You and each creature in the area that you choose to affect take on the appearance of a harmless creature or object, chosen by you. Each image is identical, and only appearance is affected. Sound, movement, or physical inspection can reveal the ruse.\n\nA creature that uses its action to study the image visually can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, that creature sees through the image.",
