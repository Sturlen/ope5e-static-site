    "desc": "You harness the power of fire contained in ley lines with this spell. You create a 60-foot cone of flame. Creatures in the cone take 6d6 fire damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. You can then flow along the flames, reappearing anywhere inside the cone’s area. This repositioning doesn’t count as movement and doesn’t trigger opportunity attacks.",
