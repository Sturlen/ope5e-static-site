On a successful saving throw, the target is instead slowed until the end of its next turn and the spell ends.\n\nA creature restrained by this spell makes a second saving throw at the end of its turn. On a success, the spell ends. On a failure, the target is petrified for the duration. If you maintain concentration for the maximum duration of the spell, this petrification is permanent.\n\nAny pieces removed from a petrified creature are missing when the petrification ends.",
