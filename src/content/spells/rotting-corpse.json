    "desc": "Your familiarity with the foul effects of death allows you to prevent a dead body from being returned to life using anything but the most powerful forms of magic.\n\nYou cast this spell by touching a creature that died within the last 24 hours. The body immediately decomposes to a state that prevents the body from being returned to life by the [raise dead]({{ base_url }}/spells/raise-dead) spell (though a [resurrection]({{ base_url }}/spells/resurrection) spell still works). At the end of this spell’s duration, the body decomposes to a rancid slime, and it can’t be returned to life except through a [true resurrection]({{ base_url }}/spells/true-resurrection) spell.\n",
