    "desc": "You summon up to 3 creatures from the Elemental Planes. These creatures use the statistics of a minor elemental (detailed below) with certain traits determined by your choice of its type: air, earth, fire, or water. If you summon only 2 creatures with this spell, increase its effective slot level by 1 when determining the minor elemental's statistics, and if you summon a single creature with this spell its effective slot level is increased by 2 instead.\n\nThe summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions and take their turns immediately after yours. They obey your verbal commands. When you command multiple minor elementals using this spell, you must give them all the same command.\n\nWithout such commands, a minor elemental only defends itself.\n\nThe summoned creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your concentration is broken before the spell ends, you lose control of any summoned creatures, which become hostile and might attack you and your companions. An uncontrolled creature disappears at the end of the spell's maximum duration.",
