On a failed save, any time the creature attacks with a bite, claw, slam, or other weapon that isn't manufactured, it must roll the weapon's damage dice twice and use the lower total. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. This spell has no effect on constructs.",
