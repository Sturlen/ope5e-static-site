    "desc": "You enhance the feet or hooves of a creature you touch, imbuing it with power and swiftness. The target doubles its walking speed or increases it by 30 feet, whichever addition is smaller. In addition to any attacks the creature can normally make, this spell grants two hoof attacks, each of which deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + plus the targetâ€™s Strength modifier (or 1d8 if the target of the spell is Large). For the duration of the spell, the affected creature automatically deals this bludgeoning damage to the target of its successful shove attack.",
