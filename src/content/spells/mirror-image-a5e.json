    "desc": "A total of 3 illusory copies of yourself appear in your space. For the duration, these copies move with you and mimic your actions, creating confusion as to which is real.\n\nYou can use an action to dismiss them.\n\nEach time you're targeted by a creature's attack, roll a d20 to see if it targets you or one of your copies.\n\nWith 3 copies, a roll of 6 or higher means a copy is targeted. With two copies, a roll of 8 or higher targets a copy, and with 1 copy a roll of 11 or higher targets the copy.\n\nA copy's AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier, and when it is hit by an attack a copy is destroyed.\n\nIt may be destroyed only by an attack that hits it.\n\nAll other damage and effects have no impact.\n\nAttacking creatures that have truesight, cannot see, have blindsight, or rely on other nonvisual senses are unaffected by this spell.",
