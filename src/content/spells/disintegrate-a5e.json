A creature reduced to 0 hit points is obliterated, leaving behind nothing but fine dust, along with anything it was wearing or carrying (except magic items). Only true resurrection or a wish spell can restore it to life.\n\nThis spell automatically disintegrates nonmagical objects and creations of magical force that are Large-sized or smaller. Larger objects and creations of magical force have a 10-foot-cube portion disintegrated instead. Magic items are unaffected.",
