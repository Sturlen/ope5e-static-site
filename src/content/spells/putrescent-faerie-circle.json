{"slug":"putrescent-faerie-circle","name":"Putrescent Faerie Circle","desc":"You create a 20-foot-diameter circle of loosely-packed toadstools that spew sickly white spores and ooze a tarry substance. At the start of each of your turns, each creature within the circle must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature attempts to pass through the ring of toadstools, the toadstools release a cloud of spores, and the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 8d8 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. While a creature is poisoned, it is paralyzed. It can attempt a new Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns to remove the paralyzed condition (but not the poisoned condition).","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"60 Feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"1 Minute","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"5th-level","level_int":5,"spell_level":5,"school":"conjuration","dnd_class":"Druid, Cleric","spell_lists":["cleric","druid"],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"warlock","document__title":"Warlock Archives","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product-category/all-products/warlock-5th-edition-dnd/"}
