    "desc": "Calling upon the might of the angels, you conjure a flaming chariot made of gold and mithral in an unoccupied 10-foot‐square space you can see within range. Two horses made of fire and light pull the chariot. You and up to three other Medium or smaller creatures you designate can board the chariot (at the cost of 5 feet of movement) and are unharmed by the flames. Any other creature that touches the chariot or hits it (or a creature riding in it) with a melee attack while within 5 feet of the chariot takes 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 radiant damage. The chariot has AC 18 and 50 hit points, is immune to fire, poison, psychic, and radiant damage, and has resistance to all other nonmagical damage. The horses are not separate creatures but are part of the chariot. The chariot vanishes if it is reduced to 0 hit points, and any creature riding it falls out. The chariot has a speed of 50 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet.\n\nOn your turn, you can guide the chariot in place of your own movement. You can use a bonus action to direct it to take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action. As an action, you can use the chariot to overrun creatures in its path. On this turn, the chariot can enter a hostile creature’s space. The creature takes damage as if it had touched the chariot, is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that it can occupy, and must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone in that space.",
