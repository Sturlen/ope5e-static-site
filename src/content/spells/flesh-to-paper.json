    "desc": "A willing creature you touch becomes as thin as a sheet of paper until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is also flattened. The target canâ€™t cast spells or attack, and attack rolls against it are made with disadvantage. It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while next to a wall or similar flat surface. The target can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. If it occupies the same space as an object or a creature when the spell ends, the creature is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it was moved.\n",
