    "desc": "You imbue a willing creature with a touch of lycanthropy. The target gains a few bestial qualities appropriate to the type of lycanthrope you choose, such as tufts of fur, elongated claws, a fang-lined maw or tusks, and similar features. For the duration, the target has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered. In addition, the target has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. Finally, the creature can use its new claws and jaw or tusks to make unarmed strikes. The claws deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + the target's Strength modifier on a hit. The bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + the target's Strength modifier on a hit. The target's bite doesn't inflict lycanthropy.",
