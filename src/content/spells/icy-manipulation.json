{"slug":"icy-manipulation","name":"Icy Manipulation","desc":"One creature you can see within range must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is petrified (frozen solid). A petrified creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself if it makes two successful saves. If a petrified creature gets two failures on the saving throw (not counting the original failure that caused the petrification), the petrification becomes permenant.\n\nThe petrification also becomes permanent if you maintain concentration on this spell for a full minute. A permanently petrified/frozen creature can be restored to normal with [greater restoration]({{ base_url }}/spells/greater-restoration) or comparable magic, or by casting this spell on the creature again and maintaining concentration for a full minute.\n\nIf the frozen creature is damaged or broken before it recovers from being petrified, the injury carries over to its normal state.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"60 feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"a piece of ice preserved from the plane of elemental ice","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"6th-level","level_int":6,"spell_level":6,"school":"transmutation","dnd_class":"Sorcerer, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
