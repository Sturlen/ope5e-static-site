    "desc": "You attempt to sense the presence of otherworldly forces. You automatically know if there is a place or object within range that has been magically consecrated or desecrated. In addition, on the round you cast it and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you may make a Wisdom (Religion) check against the passive Deception score of any aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead creature within range. On a success, you sense the creature's presence, as well as where the creature is located.\n\nThe spell penetrates most barriers but is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead.",
