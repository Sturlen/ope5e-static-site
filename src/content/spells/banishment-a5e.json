{"slug":"banishment-a5e","name":"Banishment","desc":"You employ sheer force of will to make reality question the existence of a nearby creature, causing them to warp visibly in front of you.\n\nUntil the spell ends, a target native to your current plane is banished to a harmless demiplane and incapacitated. At the end of the duration the target reappears in the space it left (or the nearest unoccupied space). A target native to a different plane is instead banished to its native plane.\n\nAt the end of each of its turns, a banished creature can repeat the saving throw with a -1 penalty for each round it has spent banished, returning on a success. If the spell ends before its maximum duration, the target reappears in the space it left (or the nearest unoccupied space) but otherwise a target native to a different plane doesn't return.","higher_level":"The duration of banishment increases by 1 round for each slot level above 4th.","page":"","range":"60 feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1d4+2 round","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"4th-level","level_int":4,"spell_level":4,"school":"Abjuration","dnd_class":"Cleric, Herald, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
