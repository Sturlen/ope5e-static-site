    "desc": "Until the spell ends, roll 1d20 at the end of each of your turns. When you roll an 11 or higher you disappear and reappear in the Ethereal Plane (if you are already on the Ethereal Plane, the spell fails and the spell slot is wasted). At the start of your next turn you return to an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of where you disappeared from. If no unoccupied space is available within range, you reappear in the nearest unoccupied space (determined randomly when there are multiple nearest choices). As an action, you can dismiss this spell.\n\nWhile on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear into the plane you were originally on out to a range of 60 feet, but everything is obscured by mist and in shades of gray. You can only target and be targeted by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane.\n\nCreatures on your original plane cannot perceive or interact with you, unless they are able to interact with the Ethereal Plane.",
