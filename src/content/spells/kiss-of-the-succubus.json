The target must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 5d10 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The targetâ€™s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken; this reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.\n",
