    "desc": "You create a staircase out of the nothingness of the air. A shimmering staircase 10 feet wide appears and remains for the duration. The staircase ascends at a 45-degree angle to a point as much as 60 feet above the ground. The staircase consists only of steps with no apparent support, unless you choose to have it resemble a stone or wooden structure. Even then, its magical nature is obvious, as it has no color and is translucent, and only the steps have solidity; the rest of it is no more solid than air. The staircase can support up to 10 tons of weight. It can be straight, spiral, or switchback. Its bottom must connect to solid ground, but its top need not connect to anything.",
    "higher_level": "When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the staircase extends an additional 20 feet for each slot level above 5th.",
