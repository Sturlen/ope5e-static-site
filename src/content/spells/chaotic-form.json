    "desc": "You cause the form of a willing creature to become malleable, dripping and flowing according to the target’s will as if the creature were a vaguely humanoid-shaped ooze. The creature is not affected by difficult terrain, it has advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to escape a grapple, and it suffers no penalties when squeezing through spaces one size smaller than itself. The target’s movement is halved while it is affected by **chaotic form**.\n",
