    "desc": "You create an invisible, mindless, shapeless force to perform simple tasks. The servant appears in an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see and endures until it takes damage, moves more than 60 feet away from you, or the spell ends. It has AC 10, a Strength of 2, and it can't attack.\n\nYou can use a bonus action to mentally command it to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object.\n\nThe servant can do anything a humanoid servant can do â€”fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, pouring wine, and so on. Once given a command the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until the task is completed, then waits for its next command.",
