    "name": "Awaken Object",
    "desc": "After spending the casting time enchanting a ruby along with a Large or smaller nonmagical object in humanoid form, you touch the ruby to the object. The ruby dissolves into the object, which becomes a living construct imbued with sentience. If the object has no face, a humanoid face appears on it in an appropriate location. The awakened object's statistics are determined by its size, as shown on the table below. An awakened object can use an action to make a melee weapon attack against a target within 5 feet of it. It has free will, acts independently, and speaks one language you know. It is initially friendly to anyone who assisted in its creation.\n\nAn awakened object's speed is 30 feet. If it has no apparent legs or other means of moving, it gains a flying speed of 30 feet and it can hover. Its sight and hearing are equivalent to a typical human's senses. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma can be adjusted up or down by the GM to fit unusual circumstances. A beautiful statue might awaken with increased Charisma, for example, or the bust of a great philosopher could have surprisingly high Wisdom.\n\nAn awakened object needs no air, food, water, or sleep. Damage to an awakened object can be healed or mechanically repaired.\n\n| Size | HP | AC | Attack | Str | Dex | Con | Int | Wis | Cha |\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n| T | 20 | 18 | +8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage | 4 | 18 | 10 | 2d6 | 2d6 | 2d6 |\n| S | 25 | 16 | +6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage | 6 | 14 | 10  | 3d6 | 2d6 | 2d6 |\n| M | 40 | 13 | +5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage | 10 | 12  | 10 | 3d6 | 3d6 | 2d6 |\n| L | 50 | 10 | +6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage | 14 | 10 | 10 | 3d6 | 3d6 | 2d6 + 2 |\n\n",
