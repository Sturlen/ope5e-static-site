{"slug":"web-a5e","name":"Web","desc":"Thick, sticky webs fill the area, lightly obscuring it and making it difficult terrain.\n\nYou must anchor the webs between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layer them across a flat surface. If you don't the conjured webs collapse and at the start of your next turn the spell ends.\n\nWebs layered over a flat surface are 5 feet deep.\n\nEach creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn makes a Dexterity saving throw or it is restrained as long as it remains in the webs (or until the creature breaks free).\n\nA creature restrained by the webs can escape by using its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC.\n\nAny 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.","higher_level":"When using a 4th-level spell slot, you also summon a giant wolf spider in an unoccupied space within the web's area. When using a 6th-level spell slot, you summon up to two spiders.\n\nWhen using a 7th-level spell slot, you summon up to three spiders. The spiders are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the spiders as a group, which have their own turns. The spiders obey your verbal commands, but they disappear when the spell ends or when they leave the web's area.","page":"","range":"60 feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 hour","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"2nd-level","level_int":2,"spell_level":2,"school":"Conjuration","dnd_class":"Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
