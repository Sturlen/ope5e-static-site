With a shout and a gesture, you and up to five willing friendly creatures within range are teleported up to 90 feet in that direction to spaces you can see. At the same time, up to six hostile creatures within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the hostile creature is teleported up to 90 feet in the opposite direction of where you teleport yourself and the friendly creatures to spaces you can see. You can't teleport a target into dangerous terrain, such as lava or off the edge of a cliff, and each target must be teleported to an unoccupied space that is on the ground or on a floor.",
