{"slug":"peruns-doom","name":"Perun's Doom","desc":"Deep Magic: Rothenian A powerful wind swirls from your outstretched hand toward a point you choose within range, where it explodes with a low roar into vortex of air. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on that point must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage, is pulled to the center of the cylinder, and thrown 50 feet upward into the air. If a creature hits a solid obstruction, such as a stone ceiling, when it's thrown upward, it takes bludgeoning damage as if it had fallen (50 feet - the distance it's traveled upward). For example, if a creature hits the ceiling after rising only 10 feet, it takes bludgeoning damage as if it had fallen (50 feet - 10 feet =) 40 feet, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage.","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the distance affected creatures are thrown into the air by 10 feet for each slot above 3rd.","page":"","range":"60 Feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"3rd-level","level_int":3,"spell_level":3,"school":"evocation","dnd_class":"Wizard, Sorceror, Druid","spell_lists":["wizard","druid"],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"kp","document__title":"Kobold Press Compilation","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com"}
