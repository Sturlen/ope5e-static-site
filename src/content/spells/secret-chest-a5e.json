    "desc": "You stash a chest and its contents on the Ethereal Plane. To do so, you must touch the chest and its Tiny replica. The chest can hold up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving matter. Food stored in the chest spoils after 1 day.\n\nWhile the chest is in the Ethereal Plane, you can recall it to you at any point by using an action to touch the Tiny replica. The chest reappears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can use an action at any time to return the chest to the Ethereal Plane so long as you are touching both the chest and its Tiny replica.\n\nThis effect ends if you cast the spell again on a different chest, if the replica is destroyed, or if you use an action to end the spell. After 60 days without being recalled, there is a cumulative 5% chance per day that the spell effect will end. If for whatever reason the spell ends while the chest is still in the Ethereal Plane, the chest and all of its contents are lost.",
