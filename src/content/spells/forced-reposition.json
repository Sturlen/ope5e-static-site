    "desc": "One creature of your choice that you can see within range is teleported to an unoccupied space you can see up to 60 feet above you. The space can be open air or a balcony, ledge, or other surface above you. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected. A creature teleported to open air immediately falls, taking falling damage as normal, unless it can fly or it has some other method of catching itself or preventing a fall. A creature can't be teleported into a solid object.",
    "higher_level": "If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them, but they don't need to be teleported to the same locations.",
