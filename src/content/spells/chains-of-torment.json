    "desc": "You are surrounded by an aura of dim light in a 10-foot radius as you conjure an iron chain that extends out to a creature you can see within 30 feet. The creature must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). While grappled in this way, the creature is also restrained. A creature that’s restrained at the start of its turn takes 4d6 psychic damage. You can have only one creature restrained in this way at a time.\n\nAs an action, you can scan the mind of the creature that’s restrained by your chain. If the creature gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw, you learn one discrete piece of information of your choosing known by the creature (such as a name, a password, or an important number). The effect is otherwise harmless.\n",
    "higher_level": "When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.",
