{"slug":"ley-whip","name":"Ley Whip","desc":"You channel the power of a ley line within 1 mile into a crackling tendril of multicolored ley energy. The tendril extends from your hand but doesn't interfere with your ability to hold or manipulate objects. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can direct the tendril to strike a target within 50 feet of you. Make a melee spell attack; on a hit, the tendril does 3d8 force damage and the target must make a Strength saving throw. If the saving throw fails, you can push the target away or pull it closer, up to 10 feet in either direction. Special. A geomancer with a bound ley line can cast this spell as long as he or she is on the same plane as the bound line.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"Self","target_range_sort":0,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"1 Minute","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 bonus action","level":"6th-level","level_int":6,"spell_level":6,"school":"evocation","dnd_class":"Wizard, Warlock, Sorceror, Druid","spell_lists":["warlock","wizard","druid"],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag-e","document__title":"Deep Magic Extended","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com"}
