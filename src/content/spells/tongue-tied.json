{"slug":"tongue-tied","name":"Tongue Tied","desc":"You make a choking motion while pointing at a target, which must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become unable to communicate verbally. The target’s speech becomes garbled, and it has disadvantage on Charisma checks that require speech. The creature can cast a spell that has a verbal component only by making a successful Constitution check against your spell save DC. On a failed check, the creature’s action is used but the spell slot isn’t expended.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"30 feet","target_range_sort":30,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"5th-level","level_int":5,"spell_level":5,"school":"enchantment","dnd_class":"Bard, Cleric, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
