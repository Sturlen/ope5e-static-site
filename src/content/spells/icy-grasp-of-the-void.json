    "desc": "You summon the cold, inky darkness of the Void into being around a creature that you can see. The target takes 10d10 cold damage and is restrained for the duration; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the restrained condition. A restrained creature gains one level of exhaustion at the start of each of its turns. Creatures immune to cold and that do not breathe do not gain exhaustion. A creature restrained in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.",
