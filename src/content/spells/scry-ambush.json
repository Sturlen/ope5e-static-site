{"slug":"scry-ambush","name":"Scry Ambush","desc":"You foresee your foe’s strike a split second before it occurs. When you cast this spell successfully, you also designate a number of your allies that can see or hear you equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. Those allies are also not surprised by the attack and can act normally in the first round of combat.\n\nIf you would be surprised, you must make a check using your spellcasting ability at the moment your reaction would be triggered. The check DC is equal to the current initiative count. On a failed check, you are surprised and can’t use your reaction to cast this spell until after your next turn. On a successful check, you can use your reaction to cast this spell immediately.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"Self","target_range_sort":0,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 reaction, which you take when an enemy tries to make a surprise attack against you","level":"4th-level","level_int":4,"spell_level":4,"school":"divination","dnd_class":"Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
