Each of those creatures that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead may make an immediate saving throw with advantage against the condition or possession, ending it on a success.\n* **Retribution:** Make a melee spell attack against a celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within reach. On a hit, the creature takes 7d8 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) and is stunned until the beginning of your next turn.",
