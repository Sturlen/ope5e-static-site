{"slug":"chaotic-world","name":"Chaotic World","desc":"You throw a handful of colored cloth into the air while screaming a litany of disjointed phrases. A moment later, a 30-foot cube centered on a point within range fills with multicolored light, cacophonous sound, overpowering scents, and other confusing sensory information. The effect is dizzying and overwhelming. Each enemy within the cube must make a successful Intelligence saving throw or become blinded and deafened, and fall prone. An affected enemy cannot stand up or recover from the blindness or deafness while within the area, but all three conditions end immediately for a creature that leaves the spellâ€™s area.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"60 feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"V, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":false,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"seven irregular pieces of colored cloth that you throw into the air","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"6th-level","level_int":6,"spell_level":6,"school":"illusion","dnd_class":"Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
