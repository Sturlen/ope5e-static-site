    "desc": "A ray of shifting color springs from your hand. Make a ranged spell attack against a single creature you can see within range. The rayâ€™s effect and the saving throw that applies to it depend on which color is dominant when the beam strikes its target, determined by rolling a d8.\n\n| d8 | Color | Effect | Saving Throw |\n|-|-|-|-|\n| 1 | Red | 8d10 fire damage | Dexterity |\n| 2 | Orange | 8d10 acid damage | Dexterity |\n| 3 | Yellow | 8d10 lightning damage | Dexterity |\n| 4 | Green | Target Poisoned | Constitution |\n| 5 | Blue | Target Deafened | Constitution |\n| 6 | Indigo | Target Frightened | Wisdom |\n| 7 | Violet | Target Stunned | Constitution |\n| 8 | Shifting Ray | Target Blinded | Constitution |\n\nA target takes half as much damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw. A successful Constitution or Wisdom saving throw negates the effect of a ray that inflicts a condition on the target; on a failed save, the target is affected for 5 rounds or until the effect is negated. If the result of your attack roll is a critical hit, you can choose the color of the beam that hits the target, but the attack does not deal additional damage.",
