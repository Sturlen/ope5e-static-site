{"slug":"contact-other-plane-a5e","name":"Contact Other Plane","desc":"You consult an otherworldly entity, risking your very mind in the process. Make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and suffer four levels of strife until you finish a long rest. A _greater restoration_ spell ends this effect.\n\nOn a successful save, you can ask the entity up to 5 questions before the spell ends. When possible the entity responds with one-word answers: yes, no, maybe, never, irrelevant, or unclear. At the Narrator's discretion, it may instead provide a brief but truthful answer when necessary.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"self","target_range_sort":0,"components":"V","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":false,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":true,"ritual":"yes","duration":"1 minute","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 minute","level":"5th-level","level_int":5,"spell_level":5,"school":"Divination","dnd_class":"Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
