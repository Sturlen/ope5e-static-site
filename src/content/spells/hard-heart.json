The creature you touch as part of casting this spell must make a Wisdom saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw unless it’s currently charmed. On a successful save, this spell fails. On a failed save, the target becomes immune to being charmed for the duration; if it’s currently charmed, that effect ends. In addition, Charisma checks against the target are made with disadvantage for the spell’s duration.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, the duration increases to 1 hour.
