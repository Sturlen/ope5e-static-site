    "desc": "By making mocking gestures toward one creature within\nrange that can see you, you leave the creature incapable of\nperforming at its best. If the target fails on an Intelligence\nsaving throw, roll a d4 and refer to the following table to\ndetermine what the target does on its turn. An affected\ntarget repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its\nturns, ending the effect on itself on a success or applying\nthe result of another roll on the table on a failure.\n\n| D4 | RESULT |\n|-|-|\n| 1 | Target spends its turn shouting mocking words at caster and takes a -5 penalty to its initiative roll. |\n| 2 | Target stands transfixed and blinking, takes no action. |\n| 3 | Target flees or fights (50 percent chance of each). |\n| 4 | Target charges directly at caster, enraged. |\n\n",
