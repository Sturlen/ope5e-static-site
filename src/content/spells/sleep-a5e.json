Slumbering creatures stay asleep until the spell ends, they take damage, or someone uses an action to physically wake them.\n\nAs each target falls asleep, subtract its hit points from the total before moving on to the next target.\n\nA target's hit points must be equal to or less than the total remaining for the spell to have any effect.\n\nIf the spell puts no creatures to sleep, the creature in the area with the lowest hit point total is rattled until the beginning of its next turn.\n\nConstructs and undead are not affected by this spell.",
