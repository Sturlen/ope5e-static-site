    "desc": "You summon a creature from The Dreaming.\n\nThis creature uses the statistics of a fey creature (detailed below) with certain traits determined by your choice of its type: hag, hound, or redcap.\n\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions and takes its turn immediately after yours.\n\nIt obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the creature only defends itself.\n\nThe summoned creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your concentration is broken before the spell ends, you lose control of the summoned creature, which becomes hostile and might attack you and your companions. An uncontrolled creature disappears at the end of the spell's maximum duration.",
