{"slug":"night-terrors","name":"Night Terrors","desc":"You amplify the fear that lurks in the heart of all creatures. Select a target point you can see within the spell’s range. Every creature within 20 feet of that point becomes frightened until the start of your next turn and must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become paralyzed. A paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures immune to being frightened are not affected by **night terrors**.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"120 feet","target_range_sort":120,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"a crow’s eye","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"4th-level","level_int":4,"spell_level":4,"school":"illusion","dnd_class":"Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
