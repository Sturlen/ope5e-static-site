    "desc": "When you cast this spell, a creature you designate within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or bleed from its nose, eyes, ears, and mouth. This bleeding deals no damage but imposes a –2 penalty on the creature’s Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom checks. **Blood tide** has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\nA bleeding creature might attract the attention of creatures such as stirges, sharks, or giant mosquitoes, depending on the circumstances.\n\nA [cure wounds]({{ base_url }}/spells/cure-wounds) spell stops the bleeding before the duration of blood tide expires, as does a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.",
    "higher_level": "The spell’s duration increases to 2 minutes when you reach 5th level, to 10 minutes when you reach 11th level, and to 1 hour when you reach 17th level.",
