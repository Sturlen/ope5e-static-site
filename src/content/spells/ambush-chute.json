{"slug":"ambush-chute","name":"Ambush Chute","desc":"You touch a wooden, plaster, or stone surface and create a passage with two trapdoors. The first trapdoor appears where you touch the surface, and the other appears at a point you can see up to 30 feet away. The two trapdoors can be wooden with a metal ring handle, or they can match the surrounding surfaces, each with a small notch for opening the door. The two trapdoors are connected by an extradimensional passage that is up to 5 feet wide, up to 5 feet tall, and up to 30 feet long. The trapdoors don't need to be on the same surface, allowing the passage to connect two separated locations, such as the two sides of a chasm or river. The passage is always straight and level for creatures inside it, and the creatures exit the tunnel in such a way that allows them to maintain the same orientation as when they entered the passage. No more than five creatures can transit the passage at the same time.\n  When the spell ends and the trapdoors disappear, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest the end of the passage closest to them.","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the length of the passage and the distance you can place the second trapdoor increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.","page":"","range":"Touch","target_range_sort":1,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 10 minutes","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"3rd-level","level_int":3,"spell_level":3,"school":"conjuration","dnd_class":"Sorceror, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"toh","document__title":"Tome of Heroes","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"}
