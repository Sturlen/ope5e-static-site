    "desc": "You veil a willing creature you can see within range in an illusion others perceive as their worst nightmares given flesh. When the affected creature moves at least 10 feet straight toward a creature and attacks it, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. If the affected creature’s attack hits the frightened target, the affected creature can roll the attack’s damage dice twice and use the higher total.\n  At the end of each of its turns, a creature frightened by this spell can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the creature is no longer frightened and can’t be frightened by this spell again for 24 hours.",
