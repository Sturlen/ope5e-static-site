    "desc": "This spell temporarily draws a willow tree from the Shadow Realm to the location you designate within range. The tree is 5 feet in diameter and 20 feet tall.\n  When you cast the spell, you can specify individuals who can interact with the tree. All other creatures see the tree as a shadow version of itself and can't grasp or climb it, passing through its shadowy substance. A creature that can interact with the tree and that has Sunlight Sensitivity or Sunlight Hypersensitivity is protected from sunlight while within 20 feet of the tree. A creature that can interact with the tree can climb into its branches, giving the creature half cover.",
