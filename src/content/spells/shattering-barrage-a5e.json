    "desc": "You create three orbs of jagged broken glass and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.\n\nMake a ranged spell attack for each orb. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 slashing damage and the shards of broken glass remain suspended in midair, filling the area they occupy (or 5 feet of the space they occupy if the creature is Large-sized or larger) with shards of suspended broken glass. Whenever a creature enters an area of broken glass for the first time or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 slashing damage.\n\nThe shards of broken glass dissolve into harmless wisps of sand and blow away after 1 minute.",
