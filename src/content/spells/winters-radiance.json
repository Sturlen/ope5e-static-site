A creature caught in the spell’s area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on ranged attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks for the duration of the spell. In addition, an affected creature’s vision is hampered such that foes it targets are treated as having three-quarters cover.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"400 feet (30-foot cube)","target_range_sort":400,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"a piece of polished glass","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"6th-level","level_int":6,"spell_level":6,"school":"evocation","dnd_class":"Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
