{"slug":"pitfall","name":"Pitfall","desc":"A pit opens under a Huge or smaller creature you can see within range that does not have a flying speed. This pit isnâ€™t a simple hole in the floor or ground, but a passage to an extradimensional space. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall into the pit, which closes over it. At the end of your next turn, a new portal opens 20 feet above where the pit was located, and the creature falls out. It lands prone and takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage.\n\nIf the original target makes a successful saving throw, you can use a bonus action on your turn to reopen the pit in any location within range that you can see. The spell ends when a creature has fallen through the pit and taken damage, or when the duration expires.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"60 feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"1 minute","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"4th-level","level_int":4,"spell_level":4,"school":"transmutation","dnd_class":"Sorcerer, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
