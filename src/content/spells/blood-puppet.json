    "desc": "With a sample of its blood, you are able to magically control a creature’s actions, like a marionette on magical strings. Choose a creature you can see within range whose blood you hold. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or you gain control over its physical activity (as long as you interact with the blood material component each round). As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the creature to perform various activities. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as, “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or, “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. The target is aware of being controlled. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.",
