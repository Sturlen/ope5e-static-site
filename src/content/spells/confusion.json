    "desc": "This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10 foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.\n\nAn affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.\n\n| d10 | Behavior |\n|---|---|\n| 1 | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn. |\n| 2-6 | The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn. |\n| 7-8 | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. |\n| 9-10 | The creature can act and move normally. |\n\nAt the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.",
