A creature takes 3d6 thunder damage and is poisoned for 1 minute on a failed save, or it takes half as much damage and is not poisoned on a successful one. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect for itself on a success.","higher_level":"You target an additional corpse for every 2 slot levels above 1st.","page":"","range":"60 feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"1st-level","level_int":1,"spell_level":1,"school":"Evocation","dnd_class":"Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
