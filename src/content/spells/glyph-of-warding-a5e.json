{"slug":"glyph-of-warding-a5e","name":"Glyph of Warding","desc":"You trace a glyph on the target. If the glyph is moved more than 10 feet from its original position, or if it comes within 20 feet of another glyph that you have cast, the spell ends. Finding the Tiny glyph requires an Investigation check against your spell save DC.\n\nDescribe the actions a creature must perform to trigger the spell, such as approaching within a certain distance, opening or touching the object the glyph is inscribed on, or seeing or reading the glyph. The creature must have a clear path to the glyph to trigger it. You can specify certain creatures which don't trigger the spell, such as those with a certain appearance or those who speak a certain phrase. Once the glyph is triggered, the spell ends.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, choose Explosive Runes or Spell Glyph.\n\n* **Explosive Runes:** When triggered, the glyph explodes. Creatures in a 20-foot radius sphere make a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice when you cast the spell), or half damage on a successful save. The explosion spreads around corners.\n* **Spell Glyph:** You store a spell of 3rd-level or lower as part of creating the glyph, expending its spell slot. The stored spell must target a single creature or area with a non-beneficial effect and it is cast when the glyph is triggered. A spell that targets a creature targets the triggering creature. A spell with an area is centered on the targeting creature. A creation or conjuration spell affects an area next to that creature, and targets it with any harmful effects. Spells requiring concentration last for their full duration.","higher_level":"The cost of the material component increases by 200 gold for each slot level above 3rd. For Explosive Runes, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd, and for Spell Glyph you can store a spell of up to the same level as the spell slot used to cast glyph of warding.","page":"","range":"touch","target_range_sort":1,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Permanent","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 hour","level":"3rd-level","level_int":3,"spell_level":3,"school":"Abjuration","dnd_class":"Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
