The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be charmed for the duration. While charmed, the target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.\n\n| d10  | Behavior          |\n|------|-------------------|\n| 1    | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn. |\n| 2-6  | The creature doesn't take an action this turn. |\n| 7-8  | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. |\n| 9-10 | The creature can act and move normally. |\n\nAt the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Charisma saving throw.
