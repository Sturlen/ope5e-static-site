    "desc": "A spiny array of needle-like fangs protrudes from your gums, giving you a spiny bite. For the duration, you can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the bite. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 piercing damage and must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or some of the spines in your mouth break off, sticking in the target. Until this spell ends, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or take 1d6 piercing damage from the spines. If you hit a target that has your spines stuck in it, your attack deals extra damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and more spines donâ€™t break off in the target. Your spines can stick in only one target at a time. If your spines stick into another target, the spines on the previous target crumble to dust, ending the effect on that target.\n",
    "higher_level": "When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage of the spiny bite and the spines increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 1st.",
