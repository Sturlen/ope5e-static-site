This includes its current trajectory if it's travelling.\n\nYou may locate a specific object known to you, provided that you have observed it within 30 feet at least once. You may also find the closest example of a certain type of object (for example an instrument, item of furniture, compass, or vase).\n\nWhen there is any thickness of lead in the direct path between you and the object the spell is unable to find it.",
