For the duration of the spell, you and whoever holds the other totem can communicate while either of you is in a beast shape. This isn’t a telepathic link; you simply understand each other’s verbal communication, similar to the effect of a speak with animals spell. This effect doesn’t allow a druid in beast shape to cast spells.\n",
