    "desc": "You become invisible. At the same time, an illusory copy of you appears where you're standing.\n\nThis invisibility ends when you cast a spell but the copy lasts until the spell ends.\n\nYou can use an action to move your copy up to twice your Speed, have it speak, make gestures, or behave however you'd like.\n\nYou may see and hear through your copy. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to switch between your copy's senses and your own, or back again. While using your copy's senses you are blind and deaf to your body's surroundings.\n\nThe copy is revealed as an illusion with any physical interaction, as solid objects and creatures pass through it.",
