{"slug":"greater-ley-protection","name":"Greater Ley Protection","desc":"Deep Magic: forest-bound You create a 20-foot cube of antimagic within range that specifically protects against ley line magic. Ley line spells and magical effects up to level 7 that target a creature within the cube have no effect on that target. Any active ley line spells or magical effects up to level 7 on a creature or an object in the cube is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. The area of a ley line spell or magical effect up to level 7 can't extend into the cube. If the cube overlaps an area of ley line magic, such as greater ley pulse, the part of the area that is covered by the cube is suppressed. The cube has no effect on other types of magic or spells. You can exclude specific individuals within the cube from the protection.","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level or higher, its duration is concentration, up to 1 hour.","page":"","range":"60 Feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"1 Minute","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"7th-level","level_int":7,"spell_level":7,"school":"abjuration","dnd_class":"Druid","spell_lists":["druid"],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"kp","document__title":"Kobold Press Compilation","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com"}
