For the duration, the target has immunity to effects from undead creatures that reduce its ability scores, such as a shadow's Strength Drain, or its hit point maximum, such as a specter's Life Drain. This spell doesn't prevent damage from those attacks; it prevents only the reduction in ability score or hit point maximum.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"30 Feet","target_range_sort":30,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"1 minute","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack from an undead creature","level":"1st-level","level_int":1,"spell_level":1,"school":"abjuration","dnd_class":"Cleric, Druid, Paladin","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
