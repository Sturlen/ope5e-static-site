    "desc": "You create a wall of shimmering, transparent blocks on a solid surface within range. You can make a straight wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a cylindrical wall up to 20 feet high, 1 foot thick, and 20 feet in diameter. Nonmagical ranged attacks that cross the wall vanish into the time stream with no other effect. Ranged spell attacks and ranged weapon attacks made with magic weapons that pass through the wall are made with disadvantage. A creature that intentionally enters or passes through the wall is affected as if it had just failed its initial saving throw against a [slow]({{ base_url }}/spells/slow) spell.",
