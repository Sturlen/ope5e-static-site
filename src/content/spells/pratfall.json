    "desc": "You cause a small bit of bad luck to befall a creature, making it look humorously foolish. You create one of the following effects within range: A small, oily puddle appears under the feet of your target, causing it to lose balance. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be unable use a bonus action on its next turn as it regains its footing. Tiny particles blow in your target's face, causing it to sneeze. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on its first attack roll on its next turn. Strobing lights flash briefly before your target's eyes, causing difficulties with its vision. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its passive Perception is halved until the end of its next turn. The target feels the sensation of a quick, mild clap against its ears, briefly disorienting it. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to maintain its concentration. An invisible force sharply tugs on the target's trousers, causing the clothing to slip down. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on its next attack roll with a two-handed weapon or loses its shield bonus to its Armor Class until the end of its next turn as it uses one hand to gather its slipping clothing. Only one of these effects can be used on a single creature at a time.",
