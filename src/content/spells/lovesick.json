{"slug":"lovesick","name":"Lovesick","desc":"This spell causes creatures to behave unpredictably, as they randomly experience the full gamut of emotions of someone who has fallen head over heels in love. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.\n\nAn affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.\n\n| d10 | Behavior |\n|-|-|\n| 1-3 | The creature spends its turn moping like a lovelorn teenager; it doesn’t move or take actions. |\n| 4–5 | The creature bursts into tears, takes the Dash action, and uses all its movement to run off in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. |\n| 6 | The creature uses its action to remove one item of clothing or piece of armor. Each round spent removing pieces of armor reduces its AC by 1. |\n| 7–8 | The creature drops anything it is holding in its hands and passionately embraces a randomly determined creature. Treat this as a grapple attempt which uses the Attack action. |\n| 9 | The creature flies into a jealous rage and uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature. |\n| 10 | The creature can act and move normally. |\n\nAt the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.","page":"","range":"90 feet","target_range_sort":90,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"a handful of red rose petals","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"4th-level","level_int":4,"spell_level":4,"school":"enchantment","dnd_class":"Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
