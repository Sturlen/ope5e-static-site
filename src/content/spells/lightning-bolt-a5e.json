The lightning ignites flammable objects in its path that aren't worn or carried by another creature.\n\nIf the spell is stopped by an object at least as large as its width, it ends there unless it deals enough damage to break through. When it does, it continues to the end of its area.","higher_level":"Damage increases by 1d6 for every slot level above 3rd.","page":"","range":"self","target_range_sort":0,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"3rd-level","level_int":3,"spell_level":3,"school":"Evocation","dnd_class":"Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
