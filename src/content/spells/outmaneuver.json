    "desc": "When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from an ally you can see within range, you can force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's movement is reduced to 0, and you can move up to your speed toward the creature without provoking opportunity attacks. This spell doesn't interrupt your ally's opportunity attack, which happens before the effects of this spell.",
