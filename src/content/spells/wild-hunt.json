    "desc": "While casting this spell, you must chant and drum, calling forth the spirit of the hunt. Up to nine other creatures can join you in the chant.\n  For the duration, each creature that participated in the chant is filled with the fervent bloodlust of the wild hunt and gains several benefits. The creature is immune to being charmed and frightened, it deals one extra die of damage on the first weapon or spell attack it makes on each of its turns, it has advantage on Strength or Dexterity saving throws (the creature's choice), and its Armor Class increases by 1.\n  When this spell ends, a creature affected by it suffers one level of exhaustion.",
