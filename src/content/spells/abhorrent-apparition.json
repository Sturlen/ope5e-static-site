Each creature within 15 feet of that spot takes 6d8 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you for 1 minute; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the fright. A creature frightened in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n","higher_level":"If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.","page":"","range":"60 feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"M","requires_verbal_components":false,"requires_somatic_components":false,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"a gourd with a face carved on it","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"4th-level","level_int":4,"spell_level":4,"school":"illusion","dnd_class":"Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard","spell_lists":["bard","sorcerer","wizard"],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
