    "desc": "You unleash a bolt of red-hot liquid metal at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 fire damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be coated in cooling, liquid metal for the duration. A creature coated in liquid metal takes 1d8 fire damage at the start of each of its turns as the metal scorches while it cools. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends and the liquid metal disappears.",
