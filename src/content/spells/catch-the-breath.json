{"slug":"catch-the-breath","name":"Catch the Breath","desc":"You can cast this spell as a reaction when youâ€™re targeted by a breath weapon. Doing so gives you advantage on your saving throw against the breath weapon. If your saving throw succeeds, you take no damage from the attack even if a successful save normally only halves the damage.\n\nWhether your saving throw succeeded or failed, you absorb and store energy from the attack. On your next turn, you can make a ranged spell attack against a target within 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. If you opt not to make this attack, the stored energy dissipates harmlessly.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage done by your attack increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.","page":"","range":"Self","target_range_sort":0,"components":"V","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":false,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 reaction, which you take when you make a saving throw against a breath weapon attack","level":"3rd-level","level_int":3,"spell_level":3,"school":"transmutation","dnd_class":"Bard, Cleric, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
