{"slug":"deadly-salvo","name":"Deadly Salvo","desc":"When you cast this spell, the ammunition flies from your hand with a loud bang, targeting up to five creatures or objects you can see within range. You can launch the bullets at one target or several. Make a ranged spell attack for each bullet. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 piercing damage. This damage can experience a burst, as described in the gunpowder weapon property (see the Adventuring Gear chapter), but this spell counts as a single effect for the purposes of determining how many times the damage can burst, regardless of the number of targets affected.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"120 Feet","target_range_sort":120,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"5th-level","level_int":5,"spell_level":5,"school":"transmutation","dnd_class":"Sorceror, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"toh","document__title":"Tome of Heroes","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"}
