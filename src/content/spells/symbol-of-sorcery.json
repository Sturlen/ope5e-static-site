{"slug":"symbol-of-sorcery","name":"Symbol of Sorcery","desc":"You draw an arcane symbol on an object, wall, or other surface at least 5 feet wide. When a creature other than you approaches within 5 feet of the symbol, that act triggers an arcane explosion. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be stunned. A stunned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. After this symbol explodes or when the duration expires, its power is spent and the spell ends.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"Touch","target_range_sort":1,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"a stick of incense worth 20 gp","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"8 hours","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"10 minutes","level":"7th-level","level_int":7,"spell_level":7,"school":"evocation","dnd_class":"Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
