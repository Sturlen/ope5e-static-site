    "desc": "Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or develop an overriding fear of canids, such as dogs, wolves, foxes, and worgs. For the duration, the first time the target sees a canid, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of that canid until the end of its next turn. Each time the target sees a different canid, it must make the saving throw. In addition, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while a canid is within 10 feet of it.\n",
