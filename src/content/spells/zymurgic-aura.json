{"slug":"zymurgic-aura","name":"Zymurgic Aura","desc":"A wave of putrefaction surges from you, targeting creatures of your choice within a 30-foot radius around you, speeding the rate of decay in those it touches. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful save. Its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature takes a long rest.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"Self","target_range_sort":0,"components":"V, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":false,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"7th-level","level_int":7,"spell_level":7,"school":"necromancy","dnd_class":"Druid","spell_lists":["druid"],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"warlock","document__title":"Warlock Archives","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product-category/all-products/warlock-5th-edition-dnd/"}
