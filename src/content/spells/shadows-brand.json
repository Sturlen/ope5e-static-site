    "desc": "You draw a rune or inscription no larger than your hand on the target. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be branded with the mark on a location of your choosing. The brand appears as an unintelligible mark to most creatures. Those who understand the Umbral language recognize it as a mark indicating the target is an enemy of the shadow fey. Shadow fey who view the brand see it outlined in a faint glow. The brand can be hidden by mundane means, such as clothing, but it can be removed only by the *remove curse* spell.\n  While branded, the target has disadvantage on ability checks when interacting socially with shadow fey.",
