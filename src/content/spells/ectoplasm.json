{"slug":"ectoplasm","name":"Ectoplasm","desc":"You call forth an ectoplasmic manifestation of Medium size that appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range that you can see. The manifestation lasts for the spell’s duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the manifestation takes 2d6 psychic damage, or half the damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw.\n\nAs a bonus action, you can move the manifestation up to 30 feet. It can move through a creature’s space but can’t remain in the same space as that creature. If it enters a creature’s space, that creature takes 2d6 psychic damage, or half the damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature also has disadvantage on Dexterity checks until the end of its next turn.\n\nWhen you move the manifestation, it can flow through a gap as small as 1 square inch, over barriers up to 5 feet tall, and across pits up to 10 feet wide. The manifestation sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It also leaves a thin film of ectoplasmic residue on everything it touches or moves through. This residue doesn’t illuminate the surroundings but does glow dimly enough to show the manifestation’s path. The residue dissipates 1 round after it is deposited.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.","page":"","range":"60 feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"a pinch of bone dust","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"2nd-level","level_int":2,"spell_level":2,"school":"necromancy","dnd_class":"Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
