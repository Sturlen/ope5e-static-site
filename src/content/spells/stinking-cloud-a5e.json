    "desc": "You create a roiling, noxious cloud that hinders creatures and leaves them retching. The cloud spreads around corners and lingers in the air until the spell ends.\n\nThe area is heavily obscured. A creature in the area at the start of its turn makes a Constitution saving throw or uses its action to retch and reel.\n\nCreatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on the save.\n\nA moderate wind (10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds, a strong wind (20 miles per hour) after 1 round.",
