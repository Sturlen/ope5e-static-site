    "desc": "You spend an hour anointing a rose with scented oils and imbuing it with fey magic. The first creature other than you that touches the rose before the spell ends pricks itself on the thorns and must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls into a deep slumber for 24 hours, and it can be awoken only by the greater restoration spell or similar magic or if you choose to end the spell as an action. While slumbering, the creature doesn't need to eat or drink, and it doesn't age.\n  Each time the creature takes damage, it makes a new Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the creature.",
    "higher_level": "When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration of the slumber increases to 7 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year with a 9th-level spell slot.",
