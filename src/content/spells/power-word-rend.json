    "desc": "You speak a word of power that causes the internal organs of a creature you can see within range to rupture. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 4d6 + 20 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target is below half its hit point maximum, it has disadvantage on this saving throw. This spell has no effect on creatures without vital internal organs, such as constructs, oozes, and undead.",
