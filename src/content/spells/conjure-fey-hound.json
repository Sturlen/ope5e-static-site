The hound disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\n\nThe summoned hound is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned hound, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you donâ€™t issue any commands to the hound, it stands by your side and attacks nearby creatures that are hostile to you but otherwise takes no actions.\n",
