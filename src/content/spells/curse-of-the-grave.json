{"slug":"curse-of-the-grave","name":"Curse of the Grave","desc":"You tap your connection to death to curse a humanoid, making the grim pull of the grave stronger on that creatureâ€™s soul.\n\nChoose one humanoid you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become cursed. A [remove curse]({{ base_url }}/spells/remove-curse) spell or similar magic ends this curse. While cursed in this way, the target suffers the following effects:\n\n* The target fails death saving throws on any roll but a 20.\n* If the target dies while cursed, it rises 1 round later as a vampire spawn under your control and is no longer cursed.\n* The target, as a vampire spawn, seeks you out in an attempt to serve its new master. You can have only one vampire spawn under your control at a time through this spell. If you create another, the existing one turns to dust. If you or your companions do anything harmful to the target, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it is no longer under your control.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"120 feet","target_range_sort":120,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"a pinch of dirt from a freshly dug grave","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Until dispelled","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"7th-level","level_int":7,"spell_level":7,"school":"necromancy","dnd_class":"Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
