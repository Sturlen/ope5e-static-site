{"slug":"glacial-fog","name":"Glacial Fog","desc":"As you cast this spell, a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range becomes covered in a frigid fog. Each creature that is in the area at the start of its turn while the spell remains in effect must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 cold damage and gains one level of exhaustion, and it has disadvantage on Perception checks until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and ignores the other effects.\n\nStored devices and tools are all frozen by the fog: crossbow mechanisms become sluggish, weapons are stuck in scabbards, potions turn to ice, bag cords freeze together, and so forth. Such items require the application of heat for 1 round or longer in order to become useful again.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.","page":"","range":"100 feet","target_range_sort":100,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"crystalline statue of a polar bear worth at least 25 gp","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"7th-level","level_int":7,"spell_level":7,"school":"evocation","dnd_class":"Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
