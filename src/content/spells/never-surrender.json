    "desc": "When the target is reduced to 0 hit points, it can fight looming death to stay in the fight. The target doesn't fall unconscious but must still make death saving throws, as normal. The target doesn't need to make a death saving throw until the end of its next turn, but it has disadvantage on that first death saving throw. In addition, massive damage required to kill the target outright must equal or exceed twice the target's hit point maximum instead. If the target regains 1 or more hit points, this spell ends.",
