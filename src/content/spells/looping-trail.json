    "desc": "You touch a trail no more than 1 mile in length, reconfiguring it to give it switchbacks and curves that make the trail loop back on itself. For the duration, the trail makes subtle changes in its configuration and in the surrounding environment to give the impression of forward progression along a continuous path. A creature on the trail must succeed on a Wisdom (Survival) check to notice that the trail is leading it in a closed loop.",
