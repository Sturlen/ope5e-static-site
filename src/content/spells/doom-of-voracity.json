You create a 10-foot-radius, 10-foot-deep cylindrical extra-dimensional hole on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension, the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. You can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any creature standing in the original conjured space, or on an expanded space as it grows, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in. The sloped pit edges crumble continuously, and any creature adjacent to the pit when it expands must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in. Creatures subjected to a successful pushing effect (such as by a spell like incapacitated for 2 rounds. When the spell ends, creatures within the pit must make a Constitution saving throw. Those who succeed rise up with the bottom of the pit until they are standing on the original surface. Those who fail also rise up but are stunned for 2 rounds.","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase the depth of the pit by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.","page":"","range":"120 Feet","target_range_sort":120,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"1 Minute","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"3rd-level","level_int":3,"spell_level":3,"school":"conjuration","dnd_class":"Wizard, Sorceror","spell_lists":["wizard"],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"kp","document__title":"Kobold Press Compilation","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com"}
