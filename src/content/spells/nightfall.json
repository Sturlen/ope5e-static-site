{"slug":"nightfall","name":"Nightfall","desc":"You call upon night to arrive ahead of schedule. With a sharp word, you create a 30-foot-radius cylinder of night centered on a point on the ground within range. The cylinder extends vertically for 100 feet or until it reaches an obstruction, such as a ceiling. The area inside the cylinder is normal darkness, and thus heavily obscured. Creatures inside the darkened cylinder can see illuminated areas outside the cylinder normally.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"100 feet","target_range_sort":100,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":true,"ritual":"yes","duration":"Up to 10 minutes","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"3rd-level","level_int":3,"spell_level":3,"school":"evocation","dnd_class":"Cleric, Druid, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
