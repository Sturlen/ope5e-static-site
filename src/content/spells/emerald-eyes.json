{"slug":"emerald-eyes","name":"Emerald Eyes","desc":"You attempt to convince a creature to enter a paranoid, murderous rage. Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be convinced those around it intend to steal anything and everything it possesses, from its position of employment, to the affections of its loved ones, to its monetary wealth and possessions, no matter how trusted those nearby might be or how ludicrous such a theft might seem. While affected by this spell, the target must use its action to attack the nearest creature other than itself or you. If the target starts its turn with no other creature near enough to move to and attack, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the target's head clears momentarily and it can act freely that turn. If the target starts its turn a second time with no other creature near enough to move to and attack, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.\n  Each time the target takes damage, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
