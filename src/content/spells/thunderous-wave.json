{"slug":"thunderous-wave","name":"Thunderous Wave","desc":"You initiate a shock wave centered at a point you designate within range. The wave explodes outward into a 30-foot-radius sphere. This force deals no damage directly, but every creature the wave passes through must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 30 feet and knocked prone; if it strikes a solid obstruction, it also takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, a creature is pushed 15 feet and not knocked prone, and it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage if it strikes an obstruction. The spell also emits a thunderous boom that can be heard within 400 feet.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"90 feet","target_range_sort":90,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"3rd-level","level_int":3,"spell_level":3,"school":"evocation","dnd_class":"Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
