    "desc": "You select up to ten enemies you can see that are within range. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, that creature is cursed to burst into flame if it reduces one of your allies to 0 hit points before this spellâ€™s duration expires. The affected creature takes 6d8 fire damage and 6d8 radiant damage when it bursts into flame.\n\nIf the affected creature is wearing flammable material (or is made of flammable material, such as a plant creature), it catches on fire and continues burning; the creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the end of each of its turns until the creature or one of its allies within 5 feet of it uses an action to extinguish the fire.",
