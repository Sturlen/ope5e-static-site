    "desc": "You create a gout of billowing steam in a 40-foottall cylinder with a 5-foot radius centered on a point on the ground you can see within range. Exposed flames in the area are doused. Each creature in the area when the gout first appears must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 fire damage and falls prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone.\n  The gout then covers the area in a sheen of slippery water. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.",
    "higher_level": "When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8, and you can create one additional gout of steam for each slot level above 3rd. A creature in the area of more than one gout of steam is affected only once.",
