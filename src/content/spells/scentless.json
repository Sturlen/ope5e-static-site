{"slug":"scentless","name":"Scentless","desc":"You touch a willing creature or object that is not being worn or carried. For the duration, the target gives off no odor. A creature that relies on smell has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect the target and Wisdom (Survival) checks to track the target. The target is invisible to a creature that relies solely on smell to sense its surroundings. This spell has no effect on targets with unusually strong scents, such as ghasts.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"Touch","target_range_sort":1,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"1 ounce of pure water","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"1 hour","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"1st-level","level_int":1,"spell_level":1,"school":"transmutation","dnd_class":"Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
