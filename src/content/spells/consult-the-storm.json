Choose a point within range. A short, truthful answer to your question booms from that point. It can be heard clearly by any creature within 600 feet. Each creature within 15 feet of the point takes 7d6 thunder damage, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.","page":"","range":"90 feet","target_range_sort":90,"components":"V","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":false,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"4th-level","level_int":4,"spell_level":4,"school":"divination","dnd_class":"Cleric, Druid","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
