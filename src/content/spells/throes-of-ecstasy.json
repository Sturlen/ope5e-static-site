    "desc": "Choose a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become overcome with euphoria, rendering it incapacitated for the duration. The target automatically fails Wisdom saving throws, and attack rolls against the target have advantage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends on the target and it gains one level of exhaustion. If the spell continues for its maximum duration, the target gains three levels of exhaustion when the spell ends.\n",
