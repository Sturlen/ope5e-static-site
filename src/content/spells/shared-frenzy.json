Each friendly creature in range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, it has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and has advantage on attack rolls for the duration. However, attack rolls made against an affected creature have advantage.",
