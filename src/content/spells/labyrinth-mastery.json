    "desc": "Upon casting this spell, you immediately gain a sense of your surroundings. If you are in a physical maze or any similar structure with multiple paths and dead ends, this spell guides you to the nearest exit, although not necessarily along the fastest or shortest route.\n\nIn addition, while the spell is guiding you out of such a structure, you have advantage on ability checks to avoid being surprised and on initiative rolls.\n\nYou gain a perfect memory of all portions of the structure you move through during the spell’s duration. If you revisit such a portion, you recognize that you’ve been there before and automatically notice any changes to the environment.\n\nAlso, while under the effect of this spell, you can exit any [maze]({{ base_url }}/spells/maze) spell (and its lesser and greater varieties) as an action without needing to make an Intelligence check.",
