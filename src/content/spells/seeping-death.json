    "desc": "Your touch inflicts a virulent, flesh-eating disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the creature’s Dexterity score is reduced by 1d4, and it is afflicted with the seeping death disease for the duration.\n\nSince this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it and can end the spell early.\n\n***Seeping Death.*** The creature’s flesh is slowly liquefied by a lingering necrotic pestilence. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its Dexterity score is reduced by 1d4. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature’s Dexterity to 0, the creature dies.",
