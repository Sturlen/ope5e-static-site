{"slug":"anchoring-rope","name":"Anchoring Rope","desc":"You create a spectral lanyard. One end is tied around your waist, and the other end is magically anchored in the air at a point you select within range. You can choose to make the rope from 5 to 30 feet long, and it can support up to 800 pounds. The point where the end of the rope is anchored in midair canâ€™t be moved after the spell is cast. If this spell is cast as a reaction while you are falling, you stop at a point of your choosing in midair and take no falling damage. You can dismiss the rope as a bonus action.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional rope for every two slot levels above 1st. Each rope must be attached to a different creature.","page":"","range":"30 feet","target_range_sort":30,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"5 minutes","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action, or 1 reaction that you take while falling","level":"1st-level","level_int":1,"spell_level":1,"school":"evocation","dnd_class":"Bard, Druid, Ranger","spell_lists":["bard","druid","ranger"],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
