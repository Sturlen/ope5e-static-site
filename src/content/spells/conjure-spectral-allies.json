The spirits erupt from the ground at a point you choose within range and sweep outward. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d10 necrotic damage and becomes frightened for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened.\n  At the end of each of its turns, a creature frightened by this spell can make another saving throw. On a success, this spell ends on the creature.","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 7th.","page":"","range":"60 Feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"7th-level","level_int":7,"spell_level":7,"school":"necromancy","dnd_class":"Cleric, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"toh","document__title":"Tome of Heroes","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"}
