When you cast the spell, and as an action on subsequent turns while you maintain concentration, you can unleash a bolt of darkness at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack. If the target is in dim light or darkness, you have advantage on the roll. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 necrotic damage and is frightened of you until the start of your next turn.\n",
