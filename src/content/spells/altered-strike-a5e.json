When you reach 11th level, if you have the Extra Attack feature you make two melee weapon attacks as part of the casting of this spell instead of one. In addition, you can choose adamantine as the material.\n\nWhen you reach 17th level, your attacks with this spell deal an extra 1d6 damage.","page":"","range":"self","target_range_sort":0,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"1 round","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"Cantrip","level_int":0,"spell_level":0,"school":"Transmutation","dnd_class":"Artificer, Bard, Herald, Sorcerer, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
