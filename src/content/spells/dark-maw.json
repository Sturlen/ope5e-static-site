On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage as your shadowy fangs sink into it. If you have a bite attack (such as from a racial trait or a spell like [alter self]({{ base_url }}/spells/after-self)), you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage roll but not to your temporary hit points.\n\nIf you hit a humanoid target, you gain 1d4 temporary hit points until the start of your next turn.",
