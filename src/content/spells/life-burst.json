    "desc": "You make a jubilant shout when you cast this spell, releasing your stores of divine energy in a wave of healing. You distribute the remaining power of your Lay on Hands to allies within 30 feet of you, restoring hit points and curing diseases and poisons. This healing energy removes diseases and poisons first (starting with the nearest ally), removing 5 hit points from the hit point total for each disease or poison cured, until all the points are spent or all diseases and poisons are cured. If any hit points remain, you regain hit points equal to that amount.\n  This spell expends all of the healing energy in your Lay on Hands, which replenishes, as normal, when you finish a long rest.",
