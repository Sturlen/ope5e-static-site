{"slug":"wall-of-thorns-a5e","name":"Wall of Thorns","desc":"You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns on a solid surface. You can choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.\n\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n\nA creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. The first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.","higher_level":"Damage dealt by the wall increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.","page":"","range":"120 feet","target_range_sort":120,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 10 minutes","concentration":"yes","requires_concentration":true,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"6th-level","level_int":6,"spell_level":6,"school":"Conjuration","dnd_class":"Druid","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"}
