Bolts of arrow-shaped lightning shoot from the imaginary bow, and each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 lightning damage and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.",
