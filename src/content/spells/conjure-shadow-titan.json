    "desc": "You summon a shadow titan, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The shadow titan’s statistics are identical to a [stone giant’s]({{ base_url }}/monsters/stone-giant), with two differences: its camouflage ability works in dim light instead of rocky terrain, and the “rocks” it hurls are composed of shadow-stuff and cause cold damage.\n\nThe shadow titan is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the shadow titan; it acts on its own turn. It obeys verbal or telepathic commands that you issue to it (giving a command takes no action on your part). If you don’t issue any commands to the shadow titan, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.\n\nThe shadow titan disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.",
