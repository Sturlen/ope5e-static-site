This functions as a +1 spear that does cold damage instead of piercing damage. If the spear leaves your hand for more than 1 round, it melts and the spell ends.","higher_level":"If the spell is cast with a 4th-level spell slot, it creates a +2 spear. A 6th-level spell slot creates a +3 spear.","page":"","range":"Touch","target_range_sort":1,"components":"V, S, M","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":true,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"1 Minute","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"2nd-level","level_int":2,"spell_level":2,"school":"transmutation","dnd_class":"Wizard, Sorceror","spell_lists":["wizard"],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"kp","document__title":"Kobold Press Compilation","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com"}
