{"slug":"misstep","name":"Misstep","desc":"You gesture to a creature within range that you can see. If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw, it uses its reaction to move 5 feet in a direction you dictate. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. The spell automatically fails if you direct the target into a dangerous area such as a pit trap, a bonfire, or off the edge of a cliff, or if the target has already used its reaction.","higher_level":"","page":"","range":"30 feet","target_range_sort":30,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"Cantrip","level_int":0,"spell_level":0,"school":"Enchantment","dnd_class":"Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
