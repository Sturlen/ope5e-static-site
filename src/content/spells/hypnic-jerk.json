One of the most common is being startled awake by a sudden feeling of falling. With a snap of your fingers, you trigger that sensation in a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d6 force damage. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it drops one object it is holding. A dropped object lands in the creature's space.","higher_level":"The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).","page":"","range":"60 Feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"S","requires_verbal_components":false,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"Cantrip","level_int":0,"spell_level":0,"school":"illusion","dnd_class":"Bard, Wizard","spell_lists":["bard","wizard"],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"warlock","document__title":"Warlock Archives","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product-category/all-products/warlock-5th-edition-dnd/"}
