{"slug":"pincer","name":"Pincer","desc":"You force your enemies into a tight spot. Choose two points you can see within range. The points must be at least 30 feet apart from each other. Each point then emits a thunderous boom in a 30-foot cone in the direction of the other point. The boom is audible out to 300 feet.\n  Each creature within a cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 thunder damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the point that emitted the cone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. Objects that aren't being worn or carried within each cone are automatically pushed.","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.","page":"","range":"120 Feet","target_range_sort":120,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":"6th-level","level_int":6,"spell_level":6,"school":"evocation","dnd_class":"Wizard","spell_lists":[],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"toh","document__title":"Tome of Heroes","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"}
