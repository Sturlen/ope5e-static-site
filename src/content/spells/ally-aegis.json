Until the start of your next turn, your ally has a +5 bonus to AC and is immune to force damage. In addition, if your ally must make a saving throw against an enemyâ€™s spell that deals damage, the ally takes half as much damage on a failed saving throw and no damage on a successful save. Ally aegis offers no protection, however, against psychic damage from any source.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can target one additional ally for each slot level above 6th.","page":"","range":"60 feet","target_range_sort":60,"components":"V, S","requires_verbal_components":true,"requires_somatic_components":true,"requires_material_components":false,"material":"","can_be_cast_as_ritual":false,"ritual":"no","duration":"1 round","concentration":"no","requires_concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 reaction, which you take when your ally is hit by an attack or is targeted by a spell that deals damage other than psychic damage","level":"6th-level","level_int":6,"spell_level":6,"school":"abjuration","dnd_class":"Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard","spell_lists":["bard","sorcerer","wizard","cleric"],"archetype":"","circles":"","document__slug":"dmag","document__title":"Deep Magic 5e","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/deep-magic-for-5th-edition-hardcover/"}
