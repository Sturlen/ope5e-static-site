    "desc": "When you cast **doom of disenchantment**, your armor and shield glow with light. When a creature hits you with an attack, the spell counters any magic that provides the attack with a bonus to hit or to damage. For example, a +1 weapon would still be considered magical, but it gets neither +1 to hit nor +1 to damage on any attack against you.\n\nThe spell also suppresses other magical properties of the attack. A [sword of wounding]({{ base_url }}/magicitems/sword-of-wounding), for example, can’t cause ongoing wounds on you, and you recover hit points lost to the weapon's damage normally. If the attack was a spell, it’s affected as if you had cast [counterspell]({{ base_url }}/spells/counterspell), using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. Spells with a duration of instantaneous, however, are unaffected.",
