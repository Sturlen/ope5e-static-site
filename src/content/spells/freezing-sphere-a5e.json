    "desc": "A freezing globe streaks to a point within range and explodes, dealing 10d6 cold damage to creatures in the area. Liquid in the area is frozen to a depth of 6 inches for 1 minute. Any creature caught in the ice can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to escape.\n\nInstead of firing the globe, you can hold it in your hand. If you handle it carefully, it won't explode until a minute after you cast the spell. At any time, you or another creature can strike the globe, throw it up to 60 feet, or use it as a slingstone, causing it to explode on impact.",
