This includes its current trajectory if it's travelling.\n\nYou may locate specific, known creatures, or the nearest creature of a specific type (like a bat, gnome, or red dragon) provided that you have observed that type within 30 feet at least once. If a specific creature you seek is in a different form (for example a wildshaped druid) the spell is unable to find it.\n\nThe spell cannot travel across running water 10 feet across or widerâ€”it is unable to find the creature and the trail ends.",
