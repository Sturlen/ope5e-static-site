    "desc": "### Spellcasting \n \nAs a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four \n1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n#### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. \n \n### Divine Domain \n \nChoose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. \n \n#### Domain Spells \n \nEach domain has a list of spells-its domain spells- that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. \n \nIf you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. \n \n### Channel Divinity \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. \n \nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. \n \nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. \n \nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel \n \nDivinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. \n \n#### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead \n \nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. \n \nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Destroy Undead \n \nStarting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table. \n \n**Destroy Undead (table)** \n \n| Cleric Level | Destroys Undead of CR... | \n|--------------|--------------------------| \n| 5th          | 1/2 or lower             | \n| 8th          | 1 or lower               | \n| 11th         | 2 or lower               | \n| 14th         | 3 or lower               | \n| 17th         | 4 or lower               | \n \n### Divine Intervention \n \nBeginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. \n \nImploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. \n \nIf your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. \n \nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.",

They can be benevolent (like Tlaloc), nourishing crops with life-giving rain; they can also be martial deities (such as Perun and Thor), splitting oaks with axes of lightning or battering their foes with thunderous hammers; and some (like Tiamat) are fearsome destroyers, spoken of only in whispers so as to avoid drawing their malevolent attention.

If a creature hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to target it with this ability. The creature must be within 5 feet of you, and you must be able to see it. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 damage on a failure. On a success, the creature takes only half damage. You may choose to deal either lightning or thunder damage with this ability.\n\nYou may use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (at least once). When you finish a long rest, you regain your expended uses.\n\n##### Channel Divinity: Full Fury\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to increase the fury of your storm based attacks. Whenever you would deal lightning or thunder damage from an attack, rather than roll damage, you can use the Channel Divinity feature to deal the maximum possible damage.\n\n##### Storm Blast\n\nBeginning at 6th level, you can choose to push a Large or smaller creature up to 10 feet away from you any time you deal lightning damage to it.\n\n##### Divine Strike\n\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.\n\n##### Sky’s Blessing\n\nStarting at 17th level, you gain a flying speed whenever you are outdoors.

Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct. \n \n##### Blessed Healer \n \nBeginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level. \n \n##### Divine Strike \n \nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. \n \n##### Supreme Healing \n \nStarting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.",

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can use your Channel Divinity to add +5 to the attack's damage. If you score a critical hit with the attack, add +10 to the attack's damage instead.\n\n##### Pack Hunter\nStarting at 6th level, when an ally within 30 feet of you makes a weapon attack roll against a creature you attacked within this round, you can use your reaction to grant that ally advantage on the attack roll.\n\n##### Divine Strike\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.\n\n##### Deadly Stalker\nAt 17th level, you can use an action to describe or name a creature that is familiar to you or that you can see within 120 feet. For 24 hours or until the target is dead, whichever occurs first, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your target and Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect your target.

More pragmatic mercy gods teach the best method to relieve the agony and torment brought on by monsters and the forces of evil is to bring about the end of that evil.\n **Mercy Domain Spells (table)**\n| Cleric Level | Spells                              | \n|--------------|-------------------------------------| \n| 1st          | *divine favor*, *healing word*      | \n| 3rd          | *aid*, *ray of enfeeblement*        | \n| 5th          | *bardo*, *revivify*                 | \n| 7th          | *death ward*, *sacrificial healing* | \n| 9th          | *antilife shell*, *raise dead*      |\n\n##### Bonus Proficiencies\nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you take your place on the line between the two aspects of mercy: healing and killing. You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill and with the poisoner's kit. In addition, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and martial weapons.\n\n##### Threshold Guardian\nAlso at 1st level, when you hit a creature that doesn't have all of its hit points with a melee weapon attack, the weapon deals extra radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) equal to half your proficiency bonus.\n\n##### Channel Divinity: Involuntary Aid\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to wrest the lifeforce from an injured creature and use it to heal allies. As an action, you present your holy symbol to one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that doesn't have all of its hit points. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) equal to three times your cleric level on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Then, one friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt to the target.\n\n##### Bolster the Living\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to manipulate a portion of the lifeforce that escapes a creature as it perishes. When a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to channel a portion of that energy into a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The friendly creature gains a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to half your proficiency bonus until the end of its next turn.\n\n##### Divine Strike of Mercy\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the dual nature of mercy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) to the target. If the target dies from this attack, a friendly creature you can see within 5 feet of you regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt. If no friendly creature is within 5 feet of you, you regain the hit points instead. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d6.\n\n##### Hand of Grace and Execution\nAt 17th level, you imbue the two sides of mercy into your spellcasting. Once on each of your turns, if you cast a spell that restores hit points to one creature or deals damage to one creature, you can add your proficiency bonus to the amount of hit points restored or damage dealt.",

            "desc": "You have dedicated yourself to the study and protection of the doors, gateways, and rips in the boundaries between the physical world and the infinite planar multiverse. Stepping through portals is a sacred prayer and woe betide any who seek to misuse them. Domain Spells You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Portal Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.\n\n**Portal Domain Spells**\n| Cleric Level | Spells                                    | \n|--------------|-------------------------------------------| \n| 1st          | *adjust position*, *expeditious retreat*  | \n| 3rd          | *glyph of shifting*, *misty step*         | \n| 5th          | *dimensional shove*, *portal jaunt*       | \n| 7th          | *dimension door*, *reposition*            | \n| 9th          | *pierce the veil*, *teleportation circle* |\n\n##### Bonus Proficiencies\nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and either cartographer's tools or navigator's tools (your choice). In addition, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill.\n\n##### Portal Magic\nStarting at 1st level, you gain access to spells that connect places or manipulate the space between places. Each spell with “(liminal)” listed alongside its school is a cleric spell for you, even if it doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, and you can prepare it as you would any other spell on the cleric spell list. Liminal spells include *bardo*, *devouring darkness*, *door of the far traveler*, *ethereal stairs*, *hypnagogia*, *hypnic jerk*, *mind maze*, *mirror realm*, *pierce the veil*, *reciprocating portal*, *rive*, *subliminal aversion*, and *threshold slip*. See the Magic and Spells chapter for details on these spells.\n\n##### Portal Bond\nAt 1st level, you learn to forge a bond between yourself and another creature. At the end of a short or long rest, you can touch one willing creature, establishing a magical bond between you. While bonded to a creature, you know the direction to the creature, though not its exact location, as long as you are both on the same plane of existence. As an action, you can teleport the bonded creature to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you or to the nearest unoccupied space, provided the bonded creature is willing and within a number of miles of you equal to your proficiency bonus. Alternatively, you can teleport yourself to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the bonded creature.\n  Once you teleport a creature in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. You can have only one bonded creature at a time. If you bond yourself to a new creature, the bond on the previous creature ends. Otherwise, the bond lasts until you die or dismiss it as an action.\n\n##### Channel Divinity: Dimensional Shift\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the magic of portals and teleportation. As an action, you teleport a willing target you can see, other than yourself, to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you that you can see. When you reach 10th level in this class, you can teleport an unwilling target. An unwilling target that succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw is unaffected.\n\n##### Portal Touch\nAt 6th level, you can use a bonus action to create a small portal in a space you can see within 30 feet of you. This portal lasts for 1 minute, and it doesn't occupy the space where you create it. When you cast a spell with a range of touch, you can touch any creature within your reach or within 5 feet of the portal. While the portal is active, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the portal up to 30 feet. The portal must remain within 30 feet of you. If you or the portal are ever more than 30 feet apart, the portal fades. You can have only one portal active at a time. If you create another one, the previous portal fades.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Transpositional Divine Strike\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to imbue your weapon strikes with portal magic. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you deal damage to the target as normal, and you open a brief portal next to your target or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature takes 1d8 damage of your weapon's type as a duplicate of your weapon lashes out at the creature from the portal. When you reach 14th level, you can choose two creatures, creating a portal next to each and dealing 1d8 damage of your weapon's type to each. Alternatively, you can choose one creature and deal 2d8 damage to it.\n\n##### Portal Mastery\nAt 17th level, when you see a creature use a magical gateway, teleport, or cast a spell that would teleport itself or another creature, you can use your reaction to reroute the effect, changing the destination to be an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 100 feet of you. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to use this feature again.",

You decide what your new form looks like, including height, weight, facial features, vocal tone, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. This feature works like the Change Appearance aspect of the *alter self* spell, except it lasts until you finish a short or long rest.\n  In addition, when you are reduced to less than half your hit point maximum, you can end this transformation as a reaction to regain hit points equal to 3 times your cleric level.

The power of blood is the power of sacrifice, the balance of life and death, and the spirit’s anchor within the mortal shell. The Gods of Blood seek to tap into the connection between body and soul through divine means, exploit the hidden reserves of will within one’s own vitality, and even manipulate or corrupt the body of others through these secret rites of crimson. Almost any neutral or evil deity can claim some influence over the secrets of blood magic and this domain, while the gods who watch from more moral realms shun its use beyond extenuating circumstance./n When casting divine spells as a Blood Domain cleric, consider ways to occasionally flavor your descriptions to tailor the magic’s effect on the opponent’s blood and vitality. Hold person might involve locking a target’s body into place from the blood stream out, preventing them from moving. Cure wounds may feature the controlling of blood like a needle and thread to close lacerations. Guardian of faith could be a floating, crimson spirit of dripping viscera who watches the vicinity with burning red eyes. Have fun with the themes!\n\n **Blood Domain Spells**\n | Cleric Level | Spells                                | \n |--------------|-------------------------------------------| \n | 1st          | *sleep*, *ray of sickness*                | \n | 3rd          | *ray of enfeeblement*, *crown of madness* | \n | 5th          | *haste*, *slow*                           | \n | 7th          | *blight*, *stoneskin*                     | \n | 9th          | *dominate person*, *hold monster*         |\n\n ##### Bonus Proficiencies\nAt 1st Level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.\n\n ##### Bloodletting Focus\nFrom 1st level, your divine magics draw the blood from inflicted wounds, worsening the agony of your nearby foes. When you use a spell of 1st level or higher to damage to any creatures that have blood, those creatures suffer additional necrotic damage equal to 2 + the spell’s level.\n\n ##### Channel Divinity: Blood Puppet\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to briefly control a creature’s actions against their will. As an action, you target a Large or smaller creature that has blood within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or immediately move up to half of their movement in any direction of your choice and make a single weapon attack against a creature of your choice within range. Dead or unconscious creatures automatically fail their saving throw. At 8th level, you can target a Huge or smaller creature.\n\n ##### Channel Divinity: Crimson Bond\nStarting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to focus on a sample of blood from a creature that is at least 2 ounces, and that has been spilt no longer than a week ago. As an action, you can focus on the blood of the creature to form a bond and gain information about their current circumstances. You know their approximate distance and direction from you, as well as their general state of health, as long as they are within 10 miles of you. You can maintain Concentration on this bond for up to 1 hour.\nDuring your bond, you can spend an action to attempt to connect with the bonded creature’s senses. The target makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. If they succeed, the connection is resisted, ending the bond. You suffer 2d6 necrotic damage. Upon a failed saving throw, you can choose to either see through the eyes of or hear through their ears of the target for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). During this time, you are blind or deaf (respectively) with regard to your own senses. Once this connection ends, the Crimson Bond is lost.\n\n **Health State Examples**\n | 100%    | Untouched            | \n | 99%-50% | Injured              | \n | 49%-1%  | Heavily Wounded      | \n | 0%      | Unconscious or Dying | \n | –       | Dead                 |\n\n ##### Sanguine Recall\nAt 8th level, you can sacrifice a portion of your own vitality to recover expended spell slots. As an action, you recover spell slots that have a combined level equal to or less than half of your cleric level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You immediately suffer 1d6 damage per spell slot level recovered. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you’re a 4th-level Cleric, you can recover up to two levels of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. You then suffer 2d6 damage.\n\n ##### Vascular Corruption Aura\nAt 17th level, you can emit a powerful aura as an action that extends 30 feet out from you that pulses necrotic energy through the veins of nearby foes, causing them to burst and bleed. For 1 minute, any enemy creatures with blood that begin their turn within the aura or enter it for the first time on their turn immediately suffer 2d6 necrotic damage. Any enemy creature with blood that would regain hit points while within the aura only regains half of the intended number of hit points (rounded up).\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.",
