    "desc": "### Spellcasting \n \nAn event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table. \n \n#### Spell Slots \n \nThe Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell *burning hands* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *burning hands* using either slot. \n \n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \n \nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. \n \nThe Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells. \n \n### Sorcerous Origin \n \nChoose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description. \n \nYour choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level. \n \n### Font of Magic \n \nAt 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects. \n \n#### Sorcery Points \n \nYou have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Flexible Casting \n \nYou can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels. \n \n**_Creating Spell Slots._** You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th. \n \nAny spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest. \n \n**Creating Spell Slots (table)** \n \n| Spell Slot Level | Sorcery Point Cost | \n|------------------|--------------------| \n| 1st              | 2                  | \n| 2nd              | 3                  | \n| 3rd              | 5                  | \n| 4th              | 6                  | \n| 5th              | 7                  | \n \n**_Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points._** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level. \n \n### Metamagic \n \nAt 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level. \n \nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. \n \n#### Careful Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell. \n \n#### Distant Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell. \n \nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet. \n \n#### Empowered Spell \n \nWhen you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. \n \nYou can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. \n \n#### Extended Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours. \n \n#### Heightened Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell. \n \n#### Quickened Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. \n \n#### Subtle Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components. \n \n#### Twinned Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip). \n \nTo be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, *magic missile* and *scorching ray* aren't eligible, but *ray of frost* and *chromatic orb* are. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Sorcerous Restoration \n \nAt 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest. \n \n### Sorcerous Origins \n \nDifferent sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic.",

            "name": "Draconic Bloodline",
            "slug": "draconic-bloodline",
            "desc": "Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance. \n \n##### Dragon Ancestor \n \nAt 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later. \n \n**Draconic Ancestry (table)** \n \n| Dragon | Damage Type | \n|--------|-------------| \n| Black  | Acid        | \n| Blue   | Lightning   | \n| Brass  | Fire        | \n| Bronze | Lightning   | \n| Copper | Acid        | \n| Gold   | Fire        | \n| Green  | Poison      | \n| Red    | Fire        | \n| Silver | Cold        | \n| White  | Cold        | \n \nYou can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check. \n \n##### Draconic Resilience \n \nAs magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. \n \nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. \n \n##### Elemental Affinity \n \nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour. \n \n##### Dragon Wings \n \nAt 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn. \n \nYou can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them. \n \n##### Draconic Presence \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.",

            "desc": "The serpentfolk slithered across the surface of the world in the primordial times before the warmblooded races became dominant. They worked their will upon the land and ocean and created works to show their mastery of the magical arts. Their artistry did not end with the landscape. They also experimented on any warm-blooded creatures they captured until they had warped and molded the creatures into new and deadly forms.\n  One or more of your ancestors was experimented on or an associate of the world's earliest serpentfolk. Your ancestor's natural affinity for magic was nurtured, expanded, and warped by the experimentation of their ophidian masters in order to transform them into something closer to the serpentine ideal. Those alterations made so long ago have waxed in you, allowing you to influence intelligent creatures more easily. Now you must decide if you will follow the serpent's path of dominance and subjugation or if you will fight against their influence and use your power for a greater purpose.\n\n##### Ophidian Metabolism\nAt 1st level, your affinity with serpents grants you a measure of their hardiness. You can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) + your proficiency bonus before you suffer the effects of starvation. You also have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease.\n\n##### Patterned Scales\nAlso at 1st level, when you use magic to trick or deceive, the residual energy of your spell subtly alters how others perceive you. When you cast an illusion spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you have advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks for the duration of the spell and for 10 minutes after the spell's duration ends.\n\n##### Insinuating Serpent\nStarting at 6th level, even when a creature resists your unsettling allure, your presence gets under their skin. When you cast an enchantment or illusion spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, and your target succeeds on its saving throw against your spell, your target becomes charmed by you until the start of your next turn. If the spell you cast affects multiple targets, only one of those targets can be affected by this feature.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Spirit Venom\nAt 14th level, you sap the will and resolve of creatures that are under your sway. If you start your turn with at least one creature within 30 feet of you that is currently charmed, frightened, paralyzed, restrained, or stunned by a spell you cast or a magical effect you created, such as from a magic item, you can use your reaction to force each such creature to take 6d4 psychic damage.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you have expended all your uses of this feature, you can spend 5 sorcery points at the start of your turn to use it again.\n\n##### Mirrored Lamina\nStarting at 18th level, when you fail a saving throw against being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, restrained, or stunned by a spell or other magical effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature that cast the spell or created the magical effect to succeed on a saving throw against your spell save DC or suffer the same condition for the same duration.\n  If both you and the creature that targeted you are affected by a condition as a result of this feature and that condition allows for subsequent saving throws to end the effect, the condition ends for both of you if either one of you succeeds on a subsequent saving throw.

Perhaps one of your forebears was marked by the hungering undead. Sorcerers with this origin have an unyielding appetite for arcana and go to nearly any length to satiate their desire to increase their magical power.\n\n##### Hungry Eyes\nAt 1st level, you can sense when a creature is nearing death. You know if a creature you can see that isn't undead or a construct within 30 feet of you is below half its hit point maximum. Your spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover when targeting creatures you sense with this feature.\n\n##### Thirsty Soul\nBeginning at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). This feature can restore you to no more than half your hit point maximum.\n\n##### Feast of Arcana\nStarting at 6th level, when you reduce one or more hostile creatures to 0 hit points with one spell of 1st level or higher, you regain 1 spent sorcery point.\n\n##### Glutton for Punishment\nStarting at 14th level, you can use your reaction to intentionally fail a saving throw against a spell that deals damage and that was cast by a hostile creature. If you do so, you regain a number of spent sorcery points equal to half your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).\n\n##### Greedy Heart\nAt 18th level, when you spend sorcery points to create spell slots or use metamagic, you reduce the cost by 1 sorcery point (this can't reduce the cost below 1).",

Alternately, you or a forebear may have suffered prolonged exposure to the deafening thunderclaps of a bronze dragon's lair.

At your option, you can create a quirk or roll a d6 and consult the Resonant Body Quirks table to determine a quirk for your character.\n\n**Resonant Body Quirks (table)**\n| d6  | Quirk  | \n|---|---------| \n| 1 | You emit a faint hum, audible to any creature within 5 feet of you. | \n| 2 | In response to natural or magical thunder, your body flickers into brief transparency with the sound of each thunderclap | \n| 3 | Beasts with the Keen Hearing trait initially respond aggressively when you come within 30 feet of them. | \n| 4 | If you hold a delicate, nonmagical glass object such as a crystal wine glass for longer than one round, the object shatters. | \n| 5 | Every time you speak, your voice randomly changes in pitch, tone, and/or resonance, so that you never sound quite the same. | \n| 6 | When another living creature touches you, you emit a brief, faint tone like a chime, the volume of which increases with the force of the touch. |\n\n##### Reverberating Quintessence\nAt 1st level, you harbor sonic vibrations within you. You are immune to the deafened condition, and you have tremorsense out to a range of 10 feet. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against effects that deal thunder damage.\n  When you reach 3rd level in this class, you have resistance to thunder damage, and at 6th level, your tremorsense extends to 20 feet.\n\n##### Signature Sound\nStarting at 1st level, you can cast the *alarm* spell (audible option only) once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Once you cast *alarm* in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.\nWhen you reach 3rd level in this class, you can expend 3 sorcery points to cast the *shatter* or *silence* spell without expending a spell slot or requiring material components.\n\n##### Sonic Savant\nBeginning at 6th level, whenever you use a Metamagic option on a spell that deals thunder damage, deafens creatures, or silences or magnifies sounds, you expend only a fraction of your effort to do so. With these sorts of spells, Metamagic options that normally cost only 1 sorcery point instead cost 0 sorcery points; all other Metamagic options cost half the normal number of sorcery points (rounded up).\n  You can use your Sonic Savant feature to reduce the cost of a number of Metamagic options equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Sound and Fury\nAt 14th level, your resistance to thunder damage becomes immunity. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can change the damage type to thunder. If the spell also imposes a condition on a creature damaged by the spell, you can choose to impose the deafened condition instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Resounding Spellcasting\nBeginning when you reach 18th level, any of your cantrips that deal thunder damage affect even those creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a cantrip that deals thunder damage, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.\n  Moreover, you can increase the power of some of your spells. When you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st through 5th level that deals thunder damage, you can cause the spell to maximize its damage dice. Once you use this feature, you shouldn't use it again until you finish a long rest. Each time you use it again, you take 2d12 force damage for each level of the spell you cast. This force damage ignores any resistance or immunity to force damage you might have.",

            "slug": "rifthopper",
            "desc": "Rifthoppers are the living embodiment of wanderlust. The yearn to travel and witness unseen vistas burns in them and manifests in their ability to move nearly at the speed of thought. The origin of the rifthoppers' powers remains a mystery, as they refuse to stay in one place long enough to be studied extensively. Given the lack of empirical evidence, many scholars have hypothesized that rifthoppers absorb energy from the world itself, typically through an innate connection with ley lines or with areas where the borders between planes are thin, and can use it to alter their own magic.\n  Adventuring rifthoppers often concern themselves with investigating mysterious portals to unknown locations, researching ley lines and other mystic phenomena, or seeking out and stopping spatial and temporal disturbances.\n\n##### Teleport Object\nStarting at 1st level, you can use an action to teleport a small object that isn't being worn or carried and that you can see within 30 feet of you into your hand. Alternatively, you can teleport an object from your hand to a space you can see within 30 feet of you. The object can weigh no more than 5 pounds and must be able to fit into a 1-foot cube.\n  The weight of the object you can teleport increases when you reach certain levels in this class: at 6th (10 pounds), 14th level (15 pounds), and 18th level (20 pounds).\n\n##### Shift Space\nAt 1st level, once on each of your turns, you can spend an amount of movement equal to up to half your speed and teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within a number of feet equal to the movement you spent. If your speed is 0, such as from being grappled or restrained, you can't use this feature.\n\nWhen you reach 3rd level in this class, you can spend movement equal to your full speed, reducing your speed to 0 for the turn, and expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to teleport yourself to a destination within range. The range you can travel is dependent on the level of the spell slot expended as detailed in the Rifthopper Teleportation Distance table. You bring any objects you are wearing or carrying with you when you teleport, as long as their weight doesn't exceed your carrying capacity. If you teleport into an occupied space, you take 4d6 force damage and are pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.\n \n **Rifthopper Teleportation Distance (table)**\n| Spell Slot Level | Distance Teleported | \n|------------------|---------------------| \n| 2nd              | 30 feet             | \n| 3rd              | 60 feet             | \n| 4th              | 120 feet            | \n| 5th              | 240 feet            | \n| 6th              | 480 feet            |\n| 7th or higher    | 960 feet            |\n\n##### Tactical Swap\nAt 6th level, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you starts its turn or when you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of you is attacked, you can use your reaction to swap positions with the creature. The target must be willing.\n  If you use this feature when you or another creature is attacked, the attack's target becomes the creature that now occupies the space being attacked, not the original target.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Familiar Locations\nStarting at 14th level, if you spend an hour in a location, familiarizing yourself with its features and noting its peculiarities, you can use an action to teleport yourself and a number of willing creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you and that you can see to the location. You can teleport to this location over any distance as long as both you and it are on the same plane of existence. If the location is mobile, such as a boat or wagon, you can't familiarize yourself with it enough to use this feature.\n  You can be familiar with a number of locations equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You can choose to forget a location (no action required) to make room for familiarizing yourself with a new location.\n  You can teleport creatures with this feature a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Dimensional Ambler\nStarting at 18th level, you can use an action to transport yourself and a number of willing creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you and that you can see to the Astral Plane or to the Ethereal Plane. While you are on these planes, you and the creatures you transported can move normally, but each transported creature must stay within 60 feet of you. You can choose to return all of you to the Material Plane at any time as a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

            "desc": "One of the most omnipresent elements in the atmosphere is practically invisible and often ignored: spores. Plants of all varieties, fungal sentient life forms like mushroomfolk, and even animals emit these tiny pieces of life. You've always had an affinity for the natural world, and your innate magic is carried within the power of these omnipresent spores.\n  Spore sorcerers are regularly found among the mushroomfolk and derro who grow large gardens of fungi deep beneath the surface of the world. Spore sorcerers can also be found in any area with an abundance of plant life, such as forests, swamps, and deep jungles.\n\n##### Nature Magic\nYour affinity with the natural world and the spores that exist between all plants and creatures allows you to learn spells from the druid class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the druid spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.\n  In addition, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can cast *speak with plants* without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Spore Transmission\nAt 1st level, your spores allow you to communicate with creatures telepathically. You can use a bonus action to create a telepathic link with one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the link ends, you can telepathically speak to the target, and, if it understands at least one language, it can speak telepathically to you. The link lasts for 10 minutes or until you use another bonus action to break the link or to establish this link with a different creature.\n  If the target is unwilling, it can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the link on a success. If an unwilling target ends the link in this way, you can't establish a link with that target again for 24 hours.\n\n##### Metamagic Spore Transmission\nStarting at 6th level, the spores connecting you and the target of your Spore Transmission enhance your metamagic effects on the linked target. You gain the following benefits when using the indicated Metamagic options:\n\n***Careful Spell.*** If the spell allows a target to take only half damage on a successful saving throw, the linked target instead takes no damage.\n\n***Distant Spell.*** When you use this Metamagic option to increase the range of a touch spell, the spell's range is 60 feet when cast on the linked target.\n\n***Extended Spell.*** If cast on the linked target, the spell's duration is tripled rather than doubled, to a maximum of 36 hours.\n\n***Hungry Spell.*** If the linked target is reduced to 0 hit points with your hungry spell, you regain hit points equal to double your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2).\n\n***Lingering Spell.*** If the linked target failed its saving throw against your lingering spell, it has disadvantage on the saving throw to avoid the additional damage at the start of your next turn.\n\n***Shared Hunger Spell.*** If you use this Metamagic option on the linked target, you and the target regain hit points equal to double your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) if the target hits with its weapon attack.\n\n***Twinned Spell.*** By spending 1 additional sorcery point, you can affect the linked target in addition to the two original targets.\n\n##### Spore's Protection\nStarting at 14th level, when an attacker you can see targets you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to call forth spores to cloud its senses. The attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack hits, you gain 10 temporary hit points as the spores bind the wound for a short time. The temporary hit points last for 1 minute.\n\n##### Spore Form\nAt 18th level, you gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. In addition, as an action, you can radiate spores in a 20-foot radius around you for 1 minute. Each friendly creature that starts its turn in the area regains hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1). Each hostile creature that starts its turn in the area takes poison damage equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1). The target of your Spore Transmission regains (if it is friendly) or takes (if it is hostile) double this amount. Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

Perhaps this attraction is due to a pact one of your ancestors made with an ancient eldritch horror. Perhaps it is an unfortunate twist of circumstance. Regardless, your physiology is in a constant state of transformation as a result of your condition. Some sorcerers who arise from magical wastelands embrace their body's modifications, others take to adventuring to find a cure for what they see as their affliction, while others still seek to make a mark on the world before oblivion claims them.\n\n##### Alien Alteration\nAt 1st level, the influence of raw magical energy in your bloodline remodeled your form. You choose one of the following features as the alteration from your ancestry.\n\n***Binary Mind.*** Your cranium is larger than most creatures of your type and houses your enlarged brain, which is partitioned in a manner that allows you to work on simultaneous tasks. You can use the Search action or make an Intelligence or Wisdom check as a bonus action on your turn.\n\n***Digitigrade Legs.*** Your legs are similar to the rear legs of a wolf or horse. Your movement speed increases by 10 feet, and you can stand up from prone by spending 5 feet of movement rather than half your speed.\n\n***Grasping Tentacle.*** You can use an action to transform one of your arms into a grotesque tentacle. The tentacle is a natural melee weapon with the reach property, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack, and the tentacle deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. At the start of your turn, if you are grappling a creature with the tentacle, you can deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage to it. You don't have fine motor control over your tentacle, and you can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of spells. You can revert your tentacle back into an arm as a bonus action.\n\n***Prehensile Tail.*** You have a prehensile tail, which allows you to take the Use an Object action as a bonus action on your turn. Your tail can't wield weapons or shields, but it is capable of some manual precision, allowing you to use your tail to hold material components or perform the somatic components of spells. In addition, you can interact with up to two objects for free during your movement and action, provided you use your tail to interact with one of the objects.\n\n##### Aberrant Physiology\nStarting at 1st level, when a creature scores a critical hit on you, you can use your reaction to shift the positions of your vital organs and turn the critical hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by critical hit are canceled.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Advanced Transformation\nAt 6th level, your increase in power also increases the concentration of raw magical energy in your blood, further altering your body. The alteration you chose from your Alien Alteration feature evolves as described below. Alternatively, you can choose a second option from the Alien Alteration feature instead of evolving the alteration you chose.\n\n***Caustic Tentacle (Grasping Tentacle).*** Your tentacle excretes acidic mucus. You can use a bonus action to suppress the mucus until the start of your next turn. While the tentacle excretes acidic mucus, it deals an extra 2d6 acid damage to any target it hits. A creature that is grappled by your tentacle at the start of your turn takes the extra acid damage when it takes the bludgeoning damage.\n\n***Cognitive Split (Binary Mind).*** Your cranium expands even further as your brain swells in size. When you use your action to cast a spell, you can use a bonus action to make one melee or ranged weapon attack against a target in range.\n\n***Fell Sprinter (Digitigrade Legs).*** Your legs elongate and your body sheds some of its weight to allow you to reach greater speeds. You can take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on each of your turns. When you Dash, the extra movement you gain is double your speed instead of equal to your speed.\n\n***Third Arm (Prehensile Tail).*** Your tail extends to a length of 15 feet and the end splits into five fingerlike appendages. You can do anything with your tail you could do with a hand, such as wield a weapon. In addition, you can use your tail to drink a potion as a bonus action.\n\n##### Absorb Arcana\nStarting at 14th level, when you succeed on a saving throw against a spell that would deal damage to you, you can use your reaction and spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to reduce the damage to 0.\n\n##### Spontaneous Transformation\nAt 18th level, your body becomes more mutable. You can use a bonus action to gain a second option from the Alien Alteration feature and its evolved form from the Advanced Transformation feature for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

            "desc": "The weave and flow of magic is mysterious and feared by many. Many study the nature of the arcane in hopes of learning to harness it, while sorcerers carry innate talent to sculpt and wield the errant strands of power that shape the world. Some sorcerers occasionally find their body itself becomes a conduit for such energies, their flesh collecting and storing remnants of their magic in the form of natural runes. These anomalies are known in erudite circles as runechildren. The talents of a runechild are rare indeed, and many are sought after for study by mages and scholars alike, driven by a prevalent belief that the secrets within their body can help understand many mysteries of the arcane. Others seek to enslave them, using their bodies as tortured spell batteries for their own diabolic pursuits. Their subjugation has driven the few that exist into hiding their essence – a task that is not easy, given the revealing nature of their gifts.\n\n##### Essence Runes\nAt 1st level, your body has begun to express your innate magical energies as natural runes that hide beneath your skin. You begin with 1 Essence Rune, and gain an addi- tional rune whenever you gain a level in this class. Runes can manifest anywhere on your body, though the first usually manifests on the forehead. They remain invisible when inert.\nAt the end of a turn where you spent any number of sorcery points for any of your class features, an equal number of essence runes glow with stored energy, becoming charged runes. If you expend a charged rune to use one of your Runechild features, it returns to being an inert essence rune.\nAs a bonus action, you may spend any number of sorcery points to convert an equal number of essence runes into charged runes. If you have no sorcery points and no charged runes, you can convert a single essence rune into a charged rune as an action\nIf you have 5 or more charged runes, you emit bright light in a 5 foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Any charged runes revert to inert essence runes after you complete a long rest.\n\n##### Glyphs of Aegis\nBeginning at 1st level, you can release the stored arcane power within your runes to absorb or deflect threatening attacks against you. Whenever you take damage from an attack, hazard, or spell, you can use a reaction to expend any number of charged runes, rolling 1d6 per charged rune. You subtract the total rolled from the damage inflicted by the attack, hazard, or spell.\nAt 6th level, you can use an action to expend a charged rune, temporarily transferring a Glyph of Aegis to a creature you touch. A creature can only hold a single glyph, and it lasts for 1 hour, or until the creature is damaged by an attack, hazard, or spell. The next time that creature takes damage from any of those sources, roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the damage roll. The glyph is then lost.\n\n##### Sigilic Augmentation\nUpon reaching 6th level, you can channel your runes to temporarily bolster your physical capabilities. You can expend a charged rune as a bonus action to enhance either your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, granting you advantage on ability checks with the chosen ability score until the start of your next turn. You can choose to main- tain this benefit additional rounds by expending a charged rune at the start of each of your following turns.\n\n##### Manifest Inscriptions\nAt 6th level, you can reveal hidden glyphs and enchantments that surround you. As an action, you can expend a charged rune to cause any hidden magical marks, runes, wards, or glyphs within 15 feet of you to reveal themselves with a glow for 1 round. This glow is considered dim light for a 5 foot radius around the mark or glyph.\n\n##### Runic Torrent\nUpon reaching 14th level, you can channel your stored runic energy to instill your spells with overwhelming arcane power, bypassing even the staunchest defenses. Whenever you cast a spell, you can expend a number of charged runes equal to the spell’s level to allow it to ignore any resistance or immunity to the spell’s damage type the targets may have.\n\n##### Arcane Exemplar Form\nBeginning at 18th level, you can use a bonus action and expend 6 or more charged runes to temporarily become a being of pure magical energy. This new form lasts for 3 rounds plus 1 round for each charged rune expended over 6. While you are in your exemplar form, you gain the following benefits: \n* You have a flying speed of 40 feet. \n* Your spell save DC is increased by 2. \n* You have resistance to damage from spells. \n* When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to the spell’s level. When your Arcane Exemplar form ends, you can’t move or take actions until after your next turn, as your body recovers from the transformation.
