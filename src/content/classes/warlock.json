    "desc": "### Otherworldly Patron \n \nAt 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n \n### Pact Magic \n \nYour arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table. \n \n#### Spell Slots \n \nThe Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. \n \nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *thunderwave*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. \n \n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \n \nAt 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. \n \nThe Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. \n \n### Eldritch Invocations \n \nIn your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. \n \n### Pact Boon \n \nAt 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice. \n \n#### Pact of the Chain \n \nYou learn the *find familiar* spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known. \n \nWhen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. \n \nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. \n \n#### Pact of the Blade \n \nYou can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. \n \nYour pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. \n \nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. \n \n#### Pact of the Tome \n \nYour patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. \n \nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.\n\n\n \n> ### Your Pact Boon \n> \n> Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron's nature. \n> \n> **_Pact of the Chain._** Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One's nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it. \n> \n> **_Pact of the Blade._** If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye. \n> \n> **_Pact of the Tome._** Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Mystic Arcanum \n \nAt 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. \n \nYou can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. \n \nAt higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest. \n \n### Eldritch Master \n \nAt 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. \n \n### Eldritch Invocations \n \nIf an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. \n \n#### Agonizing Blast \n \n*Prerequisite:* eldritch blast *cantrip* \n \nWhen you cast *eldritch blast*, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit. \n \n#### Armor of Shadows \n \nYou can cast *mage armor* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### Ascendant Step \n \n*Prerequisite: 9th level* \n \nYou can cast *levitate* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### Beast Speech \n \nYou can cast *speak with animals* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Beguiling Influence \n \nYou gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills. \n \n#### Bewitching Whispers \n \n*Prerequisite: 7th level* \n \nYou can cast *compulsion* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Book of Ancient Secrets \n \n*Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature* \n \nYou can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag. \n \nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it. \n \n#### Chains of Carceri \n \n*Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature* \n \nYou can cast *hold monster* at will-targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental-without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again. \n \n#### Devil's Sight \n \nYou can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet. \n \n#### Dreadful Word \n \n*Prerequisite: 7th level* \n \nYou can cast *confusion* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Eldritch Sight \n \nYou can cast *detect magic* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Eldritch Spear \n \n*Prerequisite:* eldritch blast *cantrip* \n \nWhen you cast *eldritch blast*, its range is 300 feet. \n \n#### Eyes of the Rune Keeper \n \nYou can read all writing. \n \n#### Fiendish Vigor \n \nYou can cast *false life* on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### Gaze of Two Minds \n \nYou can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings. \n \n#### Lifedrinker \n \n*Prerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature* \n \nWhen you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). \n \n#### Mask of Many Faces \n \nYou can cast *disguise self* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Master of Myriad Forms \n \n*Prerequisite: 15th level* \n \nYou can cast *alter self* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Minions of Chaos \n \n*Prerequisite: 9th level* \n \nYou can cast *conjure elemental* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Mire the Mind \n \n*Prerequisite: 5th level* \n \nYou can cast *slow* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Misty Visions \n \nYou can cast *silent image* at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### One with Shadows \n \n*Prerequisite: 5th level* \n \nWhen you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible until you move or take an action or a reaction. \n \n#### Otherworldly Leap \n \n*Prerequisite: 9th level* \n \nYou can cast *jump* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### Repelling Blast \n \n*Prerequisite:* eldritch blast *cantrip* \n \nWhen you hit a creature with *eldritch blast*, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line. \n \n#### Sculptor of Flesh \n \n*Prerequisite: 7th level* \n \nYou can cast *polymorph* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Sign of Ill Omen \n \n*Prerequisite: 5th level* \n \nYou can cast *bestow curse* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Thief of Five Fates \n \nYou can cast *bane* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Thirsting Blade \n \n*Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Blade feature* \n \nYou can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n#### Visions of Distant Realms \n \n*Prerequisite: 15th level* \n \nYou can cast *arcane eye* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Voice of the Chain Master \n \n*Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature* \n \nYou can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiar's senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar's senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech. \n \n#### Whispers of the Grave \n \n*Prerequisite: 9th level* \n \nYou can cast *speak with dead* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Witch Sight \n \n*Prerequisite: 15th level* \n \nYou can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight. \n \n### Otherworldly Patrons \n \nThe beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence-not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return. \n \nSome patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.",

When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. \n \n##### Fiendish Resilience \n \nStarting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance. \n \n##### Hurl Through Hell \n \nStarting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. \n \nAt the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\n\n**Ancient Dragons Expanded Spells (table)**\n| Spell Level   | Spells                             | \n|---------------|------------------------------------| \n| 1st           | *inflict wounds*, *magic missile*   | \n| 2nd           | *heat metal*, *scorching ray*       | \n| 3rd           | *dispel magic*, *lightning bolt*    | \n| 4th           | *greater invisibility*, *ice storm* | \n| 5th           | *cloudkill*, *flame strike*         |\n\n##### Dragon Tongue\nStarting at 1st level, you can speak, read, and write Draconic.\n\n##### Wyrmling Blessing\nAlso starting at 1st level, your connection to your draconic patron or patrons bestows a blessing upon you. When you finish a long rest, you choose which blessing to accept. You can have only one blessing at a time. The blessing lasts until you finish a long rest.\n\n***Aquatic Affinity.*** You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater. In addition, you can communicate with beasts that can breathe water as if you had cast the *speak with animals* spell.\n\n***Draconic Hunger.*** When you are below half your hit point maximum and you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. This feature can restore you to no more than half of your hit point maximum.\n\n***Draconic Sight.*** You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, this blessing increases its range by 30 feet. In addition, you can use an action to create an invisible sensor within 30 feet of you in a location you can see or in an obvious location within range, such as behind a door or around a corner, for 1 minute. The sensor is an extension of your own senses, allowing you to see and hear through it as if you were in its place, but you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses while using this sensor. As a bonus action, you can move the sensor anywhere within 30 feet of you. The sensor can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, and if it ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You can use an action to end the sensor early.\n  A creature that can see the sensor, such as a creature benefiting from *see invisibility* or truesight, sees a luminous, intangible dragon's eye about the size of your fist.\n\n***Elemental Versatility.*** Choose one of the following when you accept this blessing: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You can't change the type until you finish a long rest and choose this blessing again. When you deal damage with a spell, you can choose for the spell's damage to be of the chosen type instead of its normal damage type.\n\n##### Draconic Mien\nAt 6th level, you begin to take on draconic aspects. When you finish a long rest, choose one of the following types of damage: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You have resistance to the chosen damage type. This resistance lasts until you finish a long rest.\n  In addition, as an action, you can harness a portion of your patrons' mighty presence, causing a spectral version of your dragon patron's visage to appear over your head. Choose up to three creatures you can see within 30 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed or frightened (your choice) until the end of your next turn. Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a short or a long rest.\n\n##### Ascended Blessing\nAt 10th level, your connection to your draconic patron or patrons grows stronger, granting you more powerful blessings. When you finish a long rest, you choose which ascended blessing to accept. While you have an ascended blessing, you receive the benefits of its associated wyrmling blessing in addition to any new features of the ascended blessing. You can have only one blessing active at a time. The blessing lasts until you finish a long rest.\n\n***Aquatic Command.*** While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Aquatic Affinity wyrmling blessing. You can cast the *control water* and *dominate beast* spells without expending spell slots. When you cast the *dominate beast* spell, you can target only beasts that can breathe water. You can cast each spell once in this way and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.\n\n***Crystallized Hunger.*** While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Draconic Hunger wyrmling blessing. When you kill a creature, you can crystallize a portion of its essence to create an essence gem. This gem functions as an *ioun stone of protection*, but it works only for you and has no value. As a bonus action, you can destroy the gem to regain one expended spell slot. You can have only one essence gem at a time. If you create a new essence gem while you already have an essence gem, the previous gem crumbles to dust and is destroyed. Once you create an essence gem, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.\n\n***Draconic Senses.*** While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Draconic Sight wyrmling blessing. You have blindsight out to a range of 15 feet, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.\n\n***Elemental Expertise.*** While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Elemental Versatility wyrmling blessing. When you cast a spell that deals damage of the chosen type, including a spell you changed using Elemental Versatility, you add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of the spell. In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to deal damage of the chosen type equal to your proficiency bonus to the attacker. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Draconic Manifestation\nAt 14th level, you can assume the form of a dragon. As an action, you can transform into a dragon with a challenge rating as high as your warlock level divided by 3, rounded down, for 1 minute. This transformation works like the *polymorph* spell, except you can take only the form of a dragon, and you don't need to maintain concentration to maintain the transformation. While you are in the form of a dragon, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. For the purpose of this feature, “dragon” refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles, drakes, and wyverns. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

            "desc": "While humanoids have vast pantheons and divine figures of every stripe, the animals of the world have much simpler forms of faith. Among each species there is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the better to speak to others and represent the animals in the fey courts and the Upper Planes. These timeless entities are connected to every animal of the kind they represent, and their primary concerns are for the well-being of these animals and the natural world as a whole.\n  Your patron is one such animal lord. Animal lords are varied in their motivations and often come into conflict with each other. They each command legions of animal followers and gather information from all of them. Unlike many other patrons, animal lords often have close relationships with those they bind with pacts, some to control, others to guide and advise. You are your animal lord's hand in the affairs of humanoids, and your allies are as numerous as the spiders in the corner or the birds in the sky.\n  You choose a specific animal lord to be your patron using the Animal Lord table. Each type of animal in the world can potentially have an animal lord. If you want to follow a specific type of animal lord, work with your GM to determine the animal lord's affinity and beast type and where that animal lord fits in the world. For a deeper dive on specific animal lords and for their game statistics, see *Creature Codex* and *Tome of Beasts 2*. These books aren't required to choose an animal lord as your patron or to play this class option.\n\n**Animal Lords (table)**\n| Animal Lord        | Affinity | Beast Type              | \n|--------------------|----------|-------------------------| \n| Bat King           | Air      | Bats                    | \n| Brother Ox         | Earth    | Hooved mammals          | \n| Lord of Vultures   | Air      | Vultures, birds of prey | \n| Mouse King         | Earth    | Rodents                 | \n| Queen of Birds     | Air      | Birds                   | \n| Queen of Cats      | Earth    | Felines                 | \n| Queen of Serpents  | Earth    | Reptiles                | \n| Queen of Scorpions | Earth    | Arachnids               | \n| Toad King          | Water    | Amphibians              |\n\n##### Expanded Spell List\nAnimal Lords let you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The Animal Lord Expanded Spells table shows the animal lord spells that are added to the warlock spell list for you, along with the spells associated with your patron's affinity: air, earth, or water.\n\n**Animal Lords Expanded Spells (table)**\n| Spell Level | Animal Lord Spells    | Air Spells       | Earth Spells         | Water Spells      | \n|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------| \n| 1st         | *Speak with Animals*  | *thunderwave*    | *longstrider*        | *fog cloud*       | \n| 2nd         | *mark prey*           | *gust of wind*   | *pass without trace* | *misty step*      | \n| 3rd         | *conjure animals*     | *fly*            | *phantom seed*       | *water breathing* | \n| 4th         | *polymorph*           | *storm of wings* | *sudden stampede*    | *control water*   | \n| 5th         | *commune with nature* | *insect plague*  | *hold monster*       | *cloudkill*       |\n\n##### Natural Blessing\nStarting at 1st level, you learn the *druidcraft* cantrip, and you gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill.\n\n##### Animalistic Insight\nAt 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to discern your foe's flaws to aid in its downfall. You can use an action to analyze one creature you can see within 30 feet of you and impart this information to your companions. You and a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus each gain one of the following benefits (your choice). This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until the analyzed creature dies. \n* You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against the analyzed creature. \n* You gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll when you hit the analyzed creature with an attack. \n* You have advantage on saving throws against the spells and effects of the analyzed creature. \n* When the analyzed creature attacks you, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 10th level in this class, each +1 bonus increases to +2.\n\n##### Patron Companion\nAt 6th level, your patron sends you a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. The companion acts as the animal lord's eyes and ears, allowing your patron to watch over you, and, at times, advise, warn, or otherwise communicate with you.\n  Choose a beast that relates to your patron (as shown in the Beast Type column in the Animal Lords table) that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. If you have the Pact of the Chain Pact Boon, this beast becomes your familiar.\n  Your patron companion is friendly to you and your companions, and you can speak with it as if you shared a language. It obeys your commands and, in combat, it shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. Your patron companion can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use a bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.\n  If your companion dies, your patron sends a new one to you after 24 hours. If your patron companions die too often, your patron might be reluctant to send a new one or might reprimand you in other ways.\n\n##### Primal Mastery\nAt 10th level, you can use your bond to your patron to tap into the innate connection between all animals. At the end of each short or long rest, choose one of the following benefits. The benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. \n* **Cat Eyes.** You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet. \n* **Chameleonic.** You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. \n* **Fangs.** You grow fangs. The fangs are a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with your fangs, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack, and your fangs deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. \n* **Hold Breath.** You can hold your breath for 10 minutes. \n* **Keen Senses.** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. \n* **Leap.** Your jump distance is doubled. \n* **Spry.** You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. \n* **Swift.** Your speed increases by 10 feet. \n* **Thick Hide.** You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class. \n* **Webbed Limbs.** You have a swimming speed of 20 feet.\n\n##### Call the Legions\nAt 14th level, you can summon a horde of beasts to come to your aid. As an action, you call upon your animal lord, and several beasts of your patron's type appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 60 feet of you. This works like a 7th-level *conjure* animals spell, except you don't need to maintain concentration. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

            "desc": "The Hunter in Darkness is an entity that sees all creatures as prey and enjoys instilling fear in its prey. It prefers intelligent prey over mere beasts, as their fear tastes so much sweeter. Hunters who display impressive prowess for hunting pique its interest. The Hunter in Darkness often bestows its power on such individuals to spread fear further than the Hunter can by itself.\n  Though your patron isn't mindless, it cares only for the thrill of the hunt and the spreading of fear. It cares not what you do with the power it grants you beyond that. Your connection with the Hunter can sometimes cause changes in your worldview. You might view every creature you meet as either predator or prey, or you might face problems with a “kill or be killed” attitude.\n\n##### Expanded Spell List\nThe Hunter in Darkness lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\n\n**Hunters in Darkness Expanded Spells (table)**\n| Spell Level   | Spells                             | \n|---------------|------------------------------------| \n| 1st           | *bloodhound*, *hunter's endurance* | \n| 2nd           | *instant snare*, *mark prey*       | \n| 3rd           | *clairvoyance*, *nondetection*     | \n| 4th           | *harry*, *heart-seeking arrow*     | \n| 5th           | *killing fields*, *legend lore*    |\n\n##### Savage Hunter\nStarting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hp, its nearest ally within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn.\n\n##### The Hunter in Darkness and Your Pact Boons\nWhen you select your pact boon at 3rd level, it is altered by your patron in the following ways.\n\n***Pact of the Chain.*** Your familiar is a hunting hound made of shadow, and it uses the statistics of a wolf.\n\n***Pact of the Blade.*** Your pact weapon can be a longbow or shortbow in addition to a melee weapon. You must provide arrows for the weapon.\n\n***Pact of the Tome.*** Your tome contains descriptions of tracks made by a multitude of creatures. If you consult your tome for 1 minute while inspecting tracks, you can identify the type of creature that left the tracks (such as a winter wolf), though not the creature's name or specific appearance (such as Frosttooth, the one-eyed leader of a notorious pack of winter wolves that terrorizes the area).\n\n##### Step Into Shadow\nBeginning at 6th level, you can disappear into darkness and reappear next to an enemy. As a bonus action while in dim light or darkness, you can disappear in a puff of inky smoke and reappear in an unoccupied space that is also in dim light or darkness within 5 feet of a creature within 30 feet of you. If that creature is frightened and you attack it, you have advantage on the attack roll. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Strike from the Dark\nBeginning at 10th level, your patron's constant hunger for fear inures you to it. You are immune to being frightened. In addition, when you are in dim light or darkness and you hit a creature with a weapon attack, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.\n\n##### Avatar of Death\nStarting at 14th level, if you reduce a target to 0 hp with a weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to force each ally of the target within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. If a creature is immune to being frightened, it is instead stunned until the end of its next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

            "desc": "You have made a pact with the ancient intelligence of a primeval forest. Before the rise of human civilization, before the time of the elves, before even the dragons, there were the forests. Empires rise and fall around them, but the forests remain as a testament to nature's endurance.\n\nHowever, times are changing, and the unchecked growth of civilization threatens the green. The intelligences that imbue the antediluvian forests seek emissaries in the world that can act beyond their boughs, and one has heard your call for power. You are a guardian of the Old Wood, a questing branch issuing from a vast, slumbering intelligence sent to act on its behalf, perhaps even to excise these lesser beings from its borders.\n\n##### Expanded Spell List\nYour connection to the forest allows you to choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\n\n**Old Wood Expanded Spells (table)**\n| Spell Level   | Spells                                      | \n|---------------|---------------------------------------------| \n| 1st           | *animal friendship*, *faerie fire*          | \n| 2nd           | *animal messenger*, *spike growth*          | \n| 3rd           | *conjure animals*, *protection from energy* | \n| 4th           | *conjure woodland beings*, *giant insect*   | \n| 5th           | *greater restoration*, *tree stride*        |\n\n##### Sap Magic\nAt 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to absorb magic from nearby spellcasting. When a creature casts a spell of a level you can cast or lower within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to synthesize the magic. The spell resolves as normal, but you have a 25% chance of regaining hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).\n\n##### Forest's Defender\nAt 1st level, your patron gifts you with the skills necessary to defend it. You gain proficiency with shields, and you learn the *shillelagh* cantrip. *Shillelagh* counts as a warlock cantrip for you, but it doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.\n\n##### The Old Wood and Your Pact Boons\nWhen you select your pact boon at 3rd level, it is altered by your patron in the following ways:\n\n***Pact of the Chain.*** When you conjure your familiar or change its form, you can choose the form of an awakened shrub or child of the briar (see *Tome of Beasts*) in addition to the usual familiar choices.\n\n***Pact of the Blade.*** The blade of the Old Wood is a weapon made of wood and thorns and grows out of your palm. When you cast *shillelagh*, your Pact Blade is affected by the spell, regardless of the form your Pact Blade takes.\n\n***Pact of the Tome.*** The Old Wood grows a tome for you. The tome's cover is hardened bark from the forest's native trees, and its pages are leaves whose color changes with the seasons. If you want to add a new spell to your book, you must first plant it in the ground. After 1 hour, the book emerges from the soil with the new spell inscribed on its leaves. If your tome is lost or destroyed, you must return to your patron forest for it to grow you a new one.\n\n##### Predatory Grace\nStarting at 6th level, you are able to cast *pass without trace* without expending a spell slot. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. In addition, difficult terrain caused by roots, underbrush, and other natural forest terrain costs you no extra movement. You can pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.\n\n##### Nature's Endurance\nAt 10th level, your patron has suffused your body with a portion of its ability to withstand harmful magic. You gain resistance to damage from spells of a level you can cast or lower.\n\n##### Avatar of the Wood\nStarting at 14th level, you can channel the power of the forest to physically transform, taking on many of its aspects. Your legs, arms, and torso elongate, your body becomes covered in thick, dark bark, and branches sprout from your head as your hair recedes. You can transform as a bonus action and the transformation lasts 1 minute. While transformed, you gain the following benefits: \n* Your Armor Class is 16 plus your Dexterity modifier. \n* You gain tremorsense with a radius of 30 feet, and your attacks can reach 5 feet further. \n* Your hands become branch-like claws, and you can use the Attack action to attack with the claws. You are proficient with the claws, and the claws count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. You add your Charisma modifier to your attack and damage rolls with the claws. The damage is slashing and the damage die is a d6. If you have the Pact of the Blade feature, your claw attack benefits from your invocations as if it was a pact weapon. \n* Your Sap Magic feature changes to Arcasynthesis: When a spell of 5th level or lower is cast within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to synthesize the magic. The spell resolves as normal, but you have a 50 percent chance of regaining 1d10 hp per level of the spell cast.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

            "desc": "Some who search for power settle on lesser gods or demon lords, others delve into deeper mysteries until they touch elder entities. These great entities build worlds, crafting mountains and species as if sculpting clay, or annihilate them utterly. Embodying creation, destruction, and the land itself, your patron is an ancient power beyond mortal understanding.\n  Primordials stand in opposition to the Great Old Ones, the other side of the scale that maintains the balance of reality. Your primordial patron speaks to you in the language of omens, dreams, or intuition, and may call upon you to defend the natural world, to root out the forces of the Void, or even to manipulate seemingly random people or locations for reasons known only to their unfathomable purpose. While you can't grasp the full measure of your patron's designs, as long as your bond is strong, there is nothing that can stand in your way.\n\n##### Expanded Spell List\nThe Primordial lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\n\n**Primordial Expanded Spells (table)**\n| Spell Level   | Spells                           | \n|---------------|----------------------------------| \n| 1st           | *command*, *healing word*        | \n| 2nd           | *lesser restoration*, *mud*      | \n| 3rd           | *power word fling*, *revivify*   | \n| 4th           | *power word rend*, *stone shape* | \n| 5th           | *conjure elemental*, *creation*  |\n\n##### Convulsion of the Worldbuilder\nAt 1st level, you can use an action to call upon the bond between your primordial patron and the world it created to ripple shockwaves through the ground. Choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you, then choose if the ripples happen in a 30-foot cone, a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide, or a 20-foot-radius burst. The ripples originate from or are centered on the point you chose, depending on the form the ripples take. Each creature in the cone, line, or burst must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. If the ground in the area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. When you reach certain levels in this class, the damage increases: at 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\n\n##### Redirection\nAt 6th level, you learn to channel the reality-bending powers of your patron to avoid attacks. When a creature you can see attacks only you, you can use your reaction to redirect the attack to a target of your choice within range of the attacker's weapon or spell. If no other target is within range, you can't redirect the attack.\n  If the attack is from a spell of 4th level or higher, you must succeed on an ability check using your spellcasting ability to redirect it. The DC equals 12 + the spell's level.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Adaptive Shroud\nAt 10th level, your bond with your patron protects you by adapting itself when you are injured. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. If you expend a spell slot as part of this reaction, the resistance lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Crushing Regard of the Primordial One\nAt 14th level, you learn to direct the weight of your patron's infinite gaze onto the unworthy. You can use an action to cause of the following effects. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n***One Creature.*** One creature you can see within 60 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d10 force damage and is paralyzed for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, a paralyzed target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the condition ends on the target.\n\n***Multiple Creatures.*** Each creature in a 20-footradius sphere centered on a point you can see within 100 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.",

            "desc": "Your patron is probability itself, the personified wellspring of chance as embodied by chosen deities, entities, and eldritch beings across the planes. By binding yourself to the Wyrdweaver, you live by the roll of the dice and the flip of the coin, delighting in the randomness of life and the thrill of new experiences. You might find yourself driven to invade a lich's keep to ask it about its favorite song, or you might leap onto a dragon's back to have the right to call yourself a dragonrider. Life with a pact-bond to your patron might not be long, but it will be exciting.\n\n##### Expanded Spell List\nThe Wyrdweaver lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock list for you.\n\n**Wyrdweaver Expanded Spells (table)**\n| Spell Level   | Spells                             | \n|---------------|------------------------------------| \n| 1st           | *bane*, *faerie fire*              | \n| 2nd           | *blur*, *frenzied bolt*            | \n| 3rd           | *bestow curse*, *hypnotic pattern* | \n| 4th           | *compulsion*, *reset*              | \n| 5th           | *battle mind*, *mislead*           |\n\n##### Probability Wellspring\nStarting at 1st level, you gain the ability to manipulate probability. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel your patron abilities. The number of probability dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.\n  You can use these dice to turn the odds in your or your ally's favor. When you or a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend probability dice from the pool, rolling the dice and adding the total result to that roll. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.\n  When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your probability dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).\n\n##### Appropriate Advantage\nAt 1st level, you learn to shift the weaves of fate to aid allies and hinder foes. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage, you can use your reaction to expend one probability die and force that creature to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, adding the probability die to the DC. On a failed save, the creature loses advantage on that roll, and one friendly creature you can see within 60 feet has advantage on its next d20 roll of the same type the creature used (attack roll, ability check, or saving throw).\n\n##### Improbable Duplicate\nAt 6th level, you can channel dark power from your patron to empower your attacks and spells. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one or more probability dice, up to half your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), and add the probability dice to the attack's damage roll.\n\n##### Inconceivable Channeling\nAt 10th level, you learn to redirect magical energy, converting the power to restore your pool of probability dice. When a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to take the damage instead. You halve the damage you take as your probability wellspring absorbs some of the magical energy. For every 10 damage prevented in this way, you regain one expended probability die. You can't regain more than half your maximum probability dice from this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Favored Soul\nStarting at 14th level, your very presence spins probability. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature loses advantage on the roll and has disadvantage on it, and you have advantage on one d20 roll of your choice within the next minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",
