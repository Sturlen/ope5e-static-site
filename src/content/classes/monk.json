    "desc": "### Unarmored Defense \n \nBeginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. \n \n### Martial Arts \n \nAt 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two- handed or heavy property. \n \nYou gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield: \n \n* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. \n* You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. \n* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. \n \nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon. \n \n### Ki \n \nStarting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. \n \nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. \n \nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. \n \nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \n \n**Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n#### Flurry of Blows \n \nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. \n \n#### Patient Defense \n \nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. \n \n#### Step of the Wind \n \nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. \n \n### Unarmored Movement \n \nStarting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. \n \nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. \n \n### Monastic Tradition \n \nWhen you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. \n \n### Deflect Missiles \n \nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. \n \nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Slow Fall \n \nBeginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Stunning Strike \n \nStarting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. \n \n### Ki-Empowered Strikes \n \nStarting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. \n \n### Evasion \n \nAt 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a *fireball* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. \n \n### Stillness of Mind \n \nStarting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened. \n \n### Purity of Body \n \nAt 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison. \n \n### Tongue of the Sun and Moon \n \nStarting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say. \n \n### Diamond Soul \n \nBeginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws. \n \nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result. \n \n### Timeless Body \n \nAt 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water. \n \n### Empty Body \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage. \n \nAdditionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the *astral projection* spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you. \n \n### Perfect Self \n \nAt 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points. \n \n### Monastic Traditions \n \nThree traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.",

They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm. \n \n##### Open Hand Technique \n \nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target: \n* It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. \n* It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you. \n* It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn. \n \n##### Wholeness of Body \n \nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. \n \n##### Tranquility \n \nBeginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a *sanctuary* spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. \n \n##### Quivering Palm \n \nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage. \n \nYou can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.",

            "desc": "The monks of Concordant Motion follow a tradition developed and honed by various goblin and kobold clans that favored tactics involving swarming warriors. The tradition combines tactical disciplines designed to encourage groups to work as one unit with practical strategies for enhancing allies. Where many warrior-monks view ki as a power best kept within, the Way of Concordant Motion teaches its followers to project their ki into their allies through ascetic meditation and mental exercises. Followers of this tradition value teamwork and promote functioning as a cohesive whole above any search for triumph or glory.\n\n##### Cooperative Ki\nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you spend ki on certain features, you can share some of the effects with your allies.\n\n***Flurry of Blows.*** When you spend ki to use Flurry of Blows, you can use a bonus action to empower up to two allies you can see within 30 feet of you instead of making two unarmed strikes. The next time an empowered ally hits a creature with an attack before the start of your next turn, the ally's attack deals extra damage of the attack's type equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die *+* your Wisdom modifier.\n\n***Patient Defense.*** When you spend ki to use Patient Defense, you can spend 1 additional ki point to share this defense with one ally you can see within 30 feet of you. That ally can immediately use the Dodge action as a reaction.\n\n***Step of the Wind.*** When you spend ki to use Step of the Wind, you can spend 1 additional ki point to share your mobility with one ally you can see within 30 feet of you. That ally can use a reaction to immediately move up to half its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.\n\n##### Deflect Strike\nAt 6th level, when an ally you can see within 30 feet is hit by a melee attack, you can spend 2 ki points as a reaction to move up to half your speed toward the ally. If you move to within 5 feet of the ally, the damage the ally takes from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If this reduces the damage to 0, you can immediately make one unarmed strike against the attacker.\n\n##### Coordinated Maneuvers\nStarting at 11th level, when you use your Cooperative Ki feature to share your Patient Defense or Step of the Wind, you can target a number of allies equal to your proficiency bonus. You must spend 1 ki point for each ally you target.\n  In addition, when you use your Cooperative Ki feature to empower your allies with your Flurry of Blows, you can make two unarmed strikes as part of the same bonus action.\n\n##### Concordant Mind\nAt 17th level, you have mastered the ability to empower your allies with your ki. As an action, you can expend 5 ki points and empower each ally of your choice within 30 feet of you. Each empowered ally immediately gains the benefits of all three of your Cooperative Ki features. This allows each empowered ally to both move and take the Dodge action as a reaction. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

They are respected and feared by students of other traditions. Once they are trained, followers of this Way travel far and wide, rarely settling in one place for long.\n\n##### Draconic Affiliation\nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you feel an affinity for one type of dragon, which you choose from the Draconic Affiliation table. You model your fighting style to match that type of dragon, and some of the features you gain from following this Way depend upon the affiliation you chose.\n\n| Dragon              | Associated Skill  | Damage Type | \n|---------------------|-------------------|-------------| \n| Black or Copper     | Stealth           | Acid        | \n| Blue or Bronze      | Insight           | Lightning   | \n| Brass, Gold, or Red | Intimidation      | Fire        | \n| Green               | Deception         | Poison      | \n| Silver or White     | History           | Cold        |\n\nWhen you make your selection, you gain proficiency in the dragon's associated skill, and you gain resistance to the listed damage type. If you already have this skill proficiency, you double your proficiency bonus with that skill.\n\n##### Draconic Onslaught\nAt 3rd level, when you use Step of the Wind then hit with an attack, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation.\n\n##### Take Flight\nStarting at 6th level, when you take the Dash action, you can spend 1 ki point to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn. While you are flying, a creature that hits you with an opportunity attack takes 2d6 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation.\n\n##### Conquering Wyrm\nBeginning at 11th level, when you take the Attack action after using Step of the Wind in the same turn, you can spend an extra 2 ki points to replace your first attack with one unarmed strike against each creature within 5 feet of the space in which you end your movement. On a hit, your unarmed strike deals an extra 4d6 of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation. You can't use this feature and your Draconic Onslaught feature in the same round.\n\n##### Scales of the Wyrm\nAt 17th level, you can harden yourself against harm like the eldest of dragons. On your turn, you can spend 4 ki points to increase your Armor Class by 2, gain temporary hit points equal to your monk level, and gain immunity to the frightened condition for 10 minutes. For the duration, when you take damage of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage you take from that source to 0.",

In areas where their Way is known, adherents are welcomed into the community and their needs are seen to in exchange for the host of benefits their presence brings to the community.\n\n##### Slow to Anger\nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you use Patient Defense and an attack hits you, you can use your reaction to halve the damage that you take. When you use Patient Defense and a melee attack made by a creature within your reach misses you, you can use your reaction to force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is knocked prone.\n  When you use either of these reactions, you can spend 1 ki point. If you do, your first melee weapon attack that hits before the end of your next turn deals extra damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.\n\n##### Unyielding Step\nStarting at 6th level, you can spend 1 ki point on your turn to ignore difficult terrain for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, your speed can't be reduced below 15 feet. If you use this feature while grappled, the creature can use its reaction to move with you whenever you move; otherwise, the grapple ends. If you use this feature while restrained but not grappled, such as by a spider's web, you break free from the restraining material unless it is capable of moving with you.\n\n##### Decisive in Wrath\nAt 11th level, when you spend 1 ki point as part of your Slow to Anger feature, all of your melee weapon attacks that hit before the end of your next turn deal extra damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.\n\n##### Thick Hide\nAt 17th level, you can spend 5 ki points as a bonus action to gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 10 minutes.",

You can have a maximum number of Turbulence dice equal to your proficiency bonus. When you hit with an attack, you can roll any number of Turbulence dice and add the total result to the damage you deal. Turbulence dice that result in a 1 or 2 are expended, otherwise you don't expend Turbulence dice when you add them to the damage you deal. You lose all accumulated Turbulence dice when you haven't made an attack or been the target of an attack by a hostile creature for 1 minute.\n\n##### Spreading Ripples\nAt 6th level, when a creature within 10 feet of you and friendly to you is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a Turbulence die.\n  When you hit with an attack and use two or more Turbulence dice on the attack's damage, you can choose one creature within 10 feet of your target that you can see. That creature takes damage equal to the roll of one of the Turbulence dice you rolled. If you spend 1 ki point, you can instead choose any number of creatures within 10 feet of your target to take that amount of damage.\n\n##### Duality of Water\nBeginning at 11th level, when you have no Turbulence dice, you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened, and you have resistance to fire damage. When you have at least one Turbulence die, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and you have resistance to cold damage.\n\n##### Tempestuous Waters\nAt 17th level, when you spend any number of ki points, you can also choose to gain an equal number of Turbulence dice, up to your proficiency bonus.",

            "desc": "Monks who practice the Way of the Tipsy Monkey lurch and waddle across the battlefield, seeming to be too intoxicated to comport themselves. Their school of fighting is typified by its low-standing stance, periods of swaying in place punctuated with bursts of wild, staggering movement, and the disorienting manner in which they seem to never be in the place they appear to be standing.\n  Despite the name of their style, monks of this Way often abstain from drinking alcohol, though they are not prohibited from doing so. Many do, however, display traits of their patron monkey in their love of jests and their easy laughter, even in the most fraught situations.\n\n##### Adaptive Fighting\nMonks of the Way of the Tipsy Monkey keep their foes off-balance by using unexpected things as weapons. Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you are proficient with improvised weapons, and you can treat them as monk weapons. When you use a magic item as an improvised weapon, you gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls with that improvised weapon based on the magic item's rarity: +1 for uncommon, +2 for rare, or +3 for very rare. At the GM's discretion, some magic items, such as rings or other magical jewelry, might not be viable as improvised weapons.\n\n##### Sway and Strike\nAt 3rd level, your unpredictable movements let you take advantage of more openings. Once per round when an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can spend 1 ki point to make an opportunity attack without spending your reaction. If this attack hits, you can force the target to roll a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it falls prone.\n\n##### Jester Style\nBeginning at 6th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to halve the damage that you take.\n  When you are prone, you don't have disadvantage on attack rolls, and enemies within 5 feet of you don't have advantage on attack rolls against you. You can stand up without spending movement anytime you spend ki on your turn.\n  You have advantage on any ability check or saving throw you make to escape from a grapple. If you fail to escape a grapple, you can spend 1 ki point to succeed instead.\n\n##### Fortune Favors the Fool\nStarting at 11th level, when you miss with an attack on your turn, the next attack you make that hits a target before the end of your turn deals an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type. If you make that attack using an improvised weapon, it deals an extra 1d10 damage of the weapon's type instead.\n\n##### Stumbling Stance\nAt 17th level, your staggering movements make you dangerous at a distance and make it difficult for foes to safely move away from you. If your speed is not 0, your reach is extended by 5 feet, and you have advantage on opportunity attacks.",

            "desc": "The inner peace of contemplation, the artistry of focused breathing, and the calm awareness which leads to pinpoint accuracy all contribute to the Way of the Unerring Arrow. Some are dedicated soldiers, others walk the path of a wandering warrior-mendicant, but all of them hone their art of self-control, spirituality, and the martial arts, combining unarmed combat with archery. Select this tradition if you want to play a character who is as comfortable trading kicks and blows as they are with snatching an arrow from the air and firing it back in a single motion.\n\n##### Archery Training\nWhen you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your particular martial arts training guides you to master the use of bows. The shortbow and longbow are monk weapons for you. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with shortbows or longbows.\n  When you make an unarmed strike as a bonus action as part of your Martial Arts feature or as part of a Flurry of Blows, you can choose for the unarmed strike to deal piercing damage as you jab the target with an arrow.\n\n##### Flurry of Deflection\nAt 3rd level, you get additional reactions equal to your proficiency bonus, but these reactions can be used only for your Deflect Missiles monk class feature. If you reduce the damage of the ranged weapon attack to 0 and the missile can be fired with a shortbow or longbow, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with your shortbow or longbow, using the missile you caught as ammunition.\n  At 9th level, when you use Deflect Missiles, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 2d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.\n\n##### Needle Eye of Insight\nAt 6th level, your attacks with shortbows and longbows count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. In addition, when you make a ranged attack with a shortbow or longbow, you can spend 1 ki point to cause your ranged attacks to ignore half cover and three-quarters cover until the start of your next turn.\n\n##### Steel Rain Blossom\nAt 11th level, you can fire arrows in a deadly rain. While wielding a shortbow or longbow, you can use an action to fire an arcing arrow at a point you can see within your weapon's normal range. As the arrow descends onto the point, it magically replicates into dozens of arrows. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take piercing damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die. A creature behind total cover automatically succeeds on this saving throw. You can increase the steel rain's damage by spending ki points. Each point you spend, to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by one Martial Arts die.\n  In addition, when you would make an unarmed strike as a bonus action as part of your Martial Arts feature or as part of a Flurry of Blows, you can choose to make a ranged attack with a shortbow or longbow instead.\n\n##### Improbable Shot\nAt 17th level, when you use your Needle Eye of Insight feature to ignore cover, you can spend 3 ki points to ignore all forms of cover instead. The arrow even passes through solid barriers, provided you have seen the target within the past minute and it is within your weapon's normal range.\n  Alternatively, you can spend 5 ki points to strike a target you have seen within the past minute that is now on a different plane or in an extradimensional space, such as through the *plane shift* or *rope trick* spells or a phase spider's Ethereal Jaunt trait. If you do so, you can't use this feature in this way again until you finish a long rest.",

They learn techniques that emulate the grace and agility of felines, including reflexively avoiding blows and bounding between opponents with ease. Embodying the Way of the Wildcat requires intense devotion, endless practice, and no small amount of daring.\n\n##### Enhanced Agility\nWhen you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill if you don't already have it. When you move at least 10 feet on your turn, you have advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) check you make before the start of your next turn.\n\n##### Feline Reflexes\nAlso at 3rd level, the inner power infusing your reflexes augments your nimbleness and makes it harder to hit you. When a creature you can see misses you with an attack, the next attack against you before the start of your next turn is made with disadvantage. This can happen only once each turn. If you spend 2 ki points when a creature you can see misses you with an attack, you can take the Dodge action as a reaction instead.\n  You can't benefit from this feature if your speed is 0.\n\n##### Springing Pounce\nStarting at 6th level, when you move at least 10 feet straight toward a creature and hit it with an attack on the same turn, you can spend 1 ki point to channel your momentum into your attack, dealing extra damage or pushing the target (your choice). If dealing extra damage, the attack deals extra damage of the weapon's type equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier. If pushing the target, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from you. If you used Step of the Wind to Dash before making the attack, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw.\n  You can use this feature only once per turn.\n\n##### Improved Feline Reflexes\nStarting at 11th level, when you take no damage after succeeding on a Dexterity saving throw as a result of the Evasion monk class feature, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed toward the source of the effect, such as the dragon or spellcaster that exhaled the lightning or cast the *fireball* that you avoided. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the source, you can spend 3 ki points to make one unarmed strike against it.\n\n##### Hundred Step Strike\nAt 17th level, you can use your Springing Pounce feature as many times each turn as you want, provided you have the movement and attacks to do so. You must still spend 1 ki point each time you channel your momentum into your attack. Each time you move after hitting a creature in this way, you don't provoke opportunity attacks. If you miss an attack, further movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal.\n  If you use Flurry of Blows with Springing Pounce and hit a different creature with each attack, you can make one additional Springing Pounce attack without spending ki, provided you have the movement to do so.",

            "desc": "To become a Cerulean Spirit is to give one’s self to the quest for unveiling life’s mysteries, bringing light to the secrets of the dark, and guarding the most powerful and dangerous of truths from those who would seek to pervert the sanctity of civilization.\nThe monks of the Cerulean Spirit are the embodiment of the phrase “know your enemy”. Through research, they prepare themselves against the ever-coming tides of evil. Through careful training, they have learned to puncture and manipulate the spiritual flow of an opponent’s body. Through understanding the secrets of their foe, they can adapt and surmount them. Then, once the fight is done, they return to record their findings for future generations of monks to study from.\n\n##### Mystical Erudition\nUpon choosing this tradition at 3rd level, you’ve undergone extensive training with the Cerulean Spirit, allowing you to mystically recall information on history and lore from the monastery’s collected volumes. Whenever you make an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (History), or Intelligence (Religion) check, you can spend 1 ki point to gain advantage on the roll.\nIn addition, you learn one language of your choice. You gain additional languages at 11th and 17th level.\n\n##### Extract Aspects\nBeginning at 3rd level when choosing this tradition, when you pummel an opponent and connect with multiple pressure points, you can extract crucial information about your foe. Whenever you hit a single creature with two or more attacks in one round, you can spend 1 ki point to force the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you learn one aspect about the creature of your choice: Creature Type, Armor Class, Senses, Highest Saving Throw Modifier, Lowest Saving Throw Modifier, Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage Immunities, or Condition Immunities.\nUpon reaching 6th level, if the target fails their saving throw, you can choose two aspects to learn. This increases to three aspects at 11th level, and four aspects at 17th level.\n\n##### Extort Truth\nAt 6th level, you can hit a series of hidden nerves on a creature with precision, temporarily causing them to be unable to mask their true thoughts and intent. If you manage to hit a single creature with two or more attacks in one round, you can spend 2 ki points to force them to make a Charisma saving throw. You can choose to have these attacks deal no damage. On a failed save, the creature is unable to speak a deliberate lie for 1 minute. You know if they succeeded or failed on their saving throw.\nAn affected creature is aware of the effect and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as the effect lasts.\n\n##### Mind of Mercury\nStarting at 6th level, you’ve honed your awareness and reflexes through mental aptitude and pattern recognition. You can take a number of additional reactions each round equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), at the cost of 1 ki point per reaction beyond the first. You can only use one reaction per trigger.\nIn addition, whenever you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check, you can spend 1 ki point to gain advantage on the roll.\n\n##### Preternatural Counter\nBeginning at 11th level, your quick mind and study of your foe allows you to use their failure to your advantage. If a creature misses you with an attack, you can immediately use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.\n\n##### Debilitating Barrage\nUpon reaching 17th level, you’ve gained the knowledge to temporarily alter and lower a creature’s fortitude by striking a series of pressure points. Whenever you hit a single creature with three or more attacks in one round, you can spend 3 ki points to give the creature disadvantage to their attack rolls until the end of your next turn, and they must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers vulnerability to a damage type of your choice for 1 minute, or until after they take any damage of that type.\nCreatures with resistance or immunity to the chosen damage type do not suffer this vulnerability, which is revealed after the damage type is chosen. You can select the damage type from the following list: acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, piercing, poison, psychic, radiant, slashing, thunder.",
