    "desc": "### Divine Sense \n \nThe presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire \n \nCount Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the *hallow* spell. \n \nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. \n \n### Lay on Hands \n \nYour blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level Ã— 5. \n \nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. \n \nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. \n \nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs. \n \n### Fighting Style \n \nAt 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. \n \n#### Defense \n \nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. \n \n#### Dueling \n \nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. \n \n#### Great Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. \n \n#### Protection \n \nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. \n \n### Spellcasting \n \nBy 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells. \n \n### Divine Smite \n \nStarting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend. \n \n### Divine Health \n \nBy 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.\n\n ### Sacred Oath \n\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description. \n \nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature. \n \n#### Oath Spells \n \nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. \n \nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you. \n \n#### Channel Divinity \n \nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it. \n \nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. \n \nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.\n\n>### Breaking Your Oath \n>\n> A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. \n> \n> A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. \n> \n> If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.\n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Aura of Protection \n \nStarting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. \n \nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \n \n### Aura of Courage \n \nStarting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious. \n \nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \n \n### Improved Divine Smite \n \nBy 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite. \n \n### Cleansing Touch \n \nBeginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. \n \nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. \n \n### Sacred Oaths \n \nBecoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.",

            "slug": "oathless-betrayer",
            "desc": "Those who fall from the loftiest heights may reach the darkest depths. A paladin who breaks their oath and turns their back on redemption may instead pledge themselves to a dark power or cause. Sometimes known as antipaladins, such betrayers may gain abilities in a mockery of their former goodness, spreading evil where once they fought for the cause of right.\n\nAt 3rd level or higher, a paladin of evil alignment may become an Oathless Betrayer. Unlike other oaths, paladins who take this path can do so in spite of having taken a previous oath, and the features of this subclass replace those of their former Sacred Oath.\n\nNote: this subclass is primarily for NPCs, but a player can choose it at their DMâ€™s discretion.\n\n##### Tenets of the Betrayer\n\nBy their very nature, Oathless Betrayers do not share any common ideals, but may hold to one of the following tenets.\n\n**_Twisted Honor._** You still cling to your former oath, but distorted to serve your new purpose. For instance, you may still demand a fair fight against a worthy adversary, but show only contempt to those you deem weak.\n\n**_Utter Depravity._** You follow some part of your former oath to the opposite extreme. If you were once honest to a fault, you might now tell lies for the simple pleasure of causing others pain.\n\n**_Misguided Revenge._** You blame your fall not on your own failings but on the actions of another, possibly one who remained righteous where you wavered. Your all-consuming hate clouds your reason, and youâ€™ve dedicated yourself to revenge at any cost for imagined wrongs.\n\n##### Oath Spells\n\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\n\n| Level | Paladin Spells                 |\n|-------|--------------------------------|\n| 3rd   | hellish rebuke, inflict wounds |\n| 5th   | crown of madness, darkness     |\n| 9th   | animate dead, bestow curse     |\n| 13th  | blight, confusion              |\n| 17th  | contagion, dominate person     |\n\n##### Channel Divinity\n\nAs an Oathless Betrayer paladin of 3rd level or higher, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.\n\n**_Command the Undead._** As an action, you may target one undead creature within 30 feet that you can see. If the target creature fails a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting DC, it is compelled to obey you for the next 24 hours. The effect ends on the target creature if you use this ability on a different target, and you cannot use this ability on an undead creature if its challenge rating exceeds or is equal to your paladin class level.\n\n**_Frightful Bearing._** As an action, you take on a menacing aspect to terrify your enemies. You target any number of creatures within 30 feet that can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Each target that fails its save becomes frightened of you. The creature remains frightened for 1 minute, but it may make a new Wisdom saving throw to end the effect if it is more than 30 feet away from you at the end of its turn.\n\n##### Aura of Loathing\n\nStarting at 7th level, you add your Charisma modifier to damage rolls from melee weapons (with a minimum bonus of +1). Creatures of the fiend or undead type within 10 feet of you also gain this bonus, but the bonus does not stack with the same bonus from another paladin.\n\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\n\n##### Unearthly Barrier\n\nBeginning at 15th level, you receive resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\n##### Master of Doom\n\nAt 20th level, as an action, you can cloak yourself and any allied creatures of your choice within 30-feet in an aura of darkness. For 1 minute, bright light in this radius becomes dim light, and any creatures that use primarily sight suffer disadvantage on attack rolls against you and the others cloaked by you.\n\nIf an enemy that starts its turn in the aura is frightened of you, it suffers 4d10 psychic damage. You may also use a bonus action to lash out with malicious energy against one creature on your turn during the duration of the aura. If you succeed on a melee spell attack against the target, you deal 3d10 + your Charisma modifier in necrotic damage.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

            "desc": "The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels-the perfect servants of good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms. \n \n##### Tenets of Devotion \n \nThough the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets. \n \n**_Honesty._** Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise. \n \n**_Courage._** Never fear to act, though caution is wise. \n \n**_Compassion._** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom. \n \n**_Honor._** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm. \n \n**_Duty._** Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you. \n \n##### Oath Spells \n \nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed. \n \n | Level | Paladin Spells                           | \n|-------|------------------------------------------| \n| 3rd   | protection from evil and good, sanctuary | \n| 5th   | lesser restoration, zone of truth        | \n| 9th   | beacon of hope, dispel magic             | \n| 13th  | freedom of movement, guardian of faith   | \n| 17th  | commune, flame strike                    | \n \n##### Channel Divinity \n \nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. \n \n**_Sacred Weapon._** As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. \n \nYou can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. \n \n**_Turn the Unholy._** As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. \n \nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. \n \n##### Aura of Devotion \n \nStarting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be charmed while you are conscious. \n \nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \n \n##### Purity of Spirit \n \nBeginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a *protection from evil and good* spell. \n \n##### Holy Nimbus \n \nAt 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. \n \nWhenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. \n \nIn addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

            "desc": "The Oath of Justice is a commitment not to the tenets of good or evil but a holy vow sworn to uphold the laws of a nation, a city, or even a tiny village. When lawlessness threatens the peace, those who swear to uphold the Oath of Justice intervene to maintain order, for if order falls to lawlessness, it is only a matter of time before all of civilization collapses into anarchy.\n  While many young paladins take this oath to protect their country and the people close to them from criminals, some older adherents to this oath know that what is just is not necessarily what is right.\n\n##### Tenets of Justice\nAll paladins of justice uphold the law in some capacity, but their oath differs depending on their station. A paladin who serves a queen upholds slightly different tenets than one who serves a small town.\n\n***Uphold the Law.*** The law represents the triumph of civilization over the untamed wilds. It must be preserved at all costs.\n\n***Punishment Fits the Crime.*** The severity of justice acts in equal measure to the severity of a wrongdoer's transgressions. Oath Spells You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Justice Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.\n\n**Oath of Justice Spells (table)**\n| Paladin Level  | Spells                              | \n|----------------|-------------------------------------| \n| 3rd            | *color spray*, *guiding bolt*       | \n| 5th            | *guiding bolt*, *zone of truth*     | \n| 9th            | *lightning bolt*, *slow*            | \n| 13th           | *faithful hound*, *locate creature* | \n| 17th           | *arcane hand*, *hold monster*       |\n\n##### Channel Divinity\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.\n\n***Tether of Righteousness.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to bind your target to you. As an action, you extend a line of energy toward a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is tethered and can't move more than 30 feet away from you for 1 minute. While tethered, the target takes lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) at the end of each of its turns. You can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check opposed by the tethered creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the creature's choice). On a success, you can pull the creature up to 15 feet in a straight line toward you. As an action, the tethered creature can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it breaks the tether.\n\n***Justicar's Celerity.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to respond to danger with lightning speed. When a creature that you can see is attacked, you can move up to your speed as a reaction. If you end your movement within 5 feet of the attacker, you can make one melee attack against it as part of this reaction. If you end your movement within 5 feet of the target of the attack, you can become the target of the attack instead as part of this reaction.\n\n##### Disciplined Pursuant\nAt 7th level, you can bend the laws of magic to parallel the laws of civilization. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a spell or Divine Smite, you can choose to knock out the creature instead of killing it. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\n  In addition, once per turn when you deal radiant damage to a creature, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. If you deal radiant damage to more than one creature, you can choose only one creature to be affected by this feature.\n\n##### Shackles of Light\nStarting at 15th level, once per turn when you deal radiant damage to a creature, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is restrained by golden, spectral chains until the end of its next turn. If you deal radiant damage to more than one creature, you can choose only one such creature to be affected by this feature. The target of this feature can be different from the target of your Disciplined Pursuant feature.\n\n##### Avatar of Perfect Order\nAt 20th level, you can take on the appearance of justice itself. As an action, you become wreathed in a garment of cold light. For 1 minute, you benefit from the following effects: \n* You are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. \n* You can use your Justicar's Celerity feature without expending a use of Channel Divinity. \n* When a creature you can see takes the Attack or Cast a Spell action, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must take a different action of your choice instead.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

            "slug": "oath-of-safeguarding",
            "desc": "Paladins who choose the Oath of Safeguarding spend their lives in service to others, conserving the people and places they vow to protect. They take missions to guard against assassination attempts, safely transport a person or group through treacherous lands, and stand as bastions for locations under attack. These paladins are no mere mercenaries, however, as they view their missions as sacred vows.\n\n##### Tenets of Safeguarding\nPaladins undertaking the Oath of Safeguarding take their responsibilities seriously and are most likely to seek atonement should they fail in their duties. However, they have no qualms about terminating their protection when their charges prove nefarious. In these cases, they won't leave people stranded in a hostile environment or situation, but they also focus their efforts on their allies over unworthy, former charges. Even when these paladins serve no charge, they seek opportunities to shield others from harm. In combat, they rush to aid their allies and stand alone to allow others to flee from battle.\n\n***Last Line of Defense.*** When your allies must retreat or regroup, you remain to ensure they have ample time to withdraw before withdrawing yourself. If your mission requires you to guard a building, you are the final obstacle the attackers face before breaching the building.\n\n***Protect the Charge.*** You pledge to preserve the lives of people you protect and the sanctity of all structures you guard, even if it means endangering yourself. When you must rest, you ensure your charge is as safe as possible, turning to trusted allies to aid you.\n\n***Shield All Innocents.*** In the absence of a sacred charge to protect, you endeavor to keep all those who can't defend themselves safe from harm. In cases where your charge must take priority, you do what you can to defend the helpless.\n\n***Uphold the Vow.*** You acknowledge the person you protect may reveal themselves as unworthy, such as by committing nefarious acts or exploiting your protection and fidelity, or the location you guard may become a site of terrible acts. When you witness this, you are free to terminate your guardianship. However, you don't leave your now-former charge in any present danger, if only for the possibility of future atonement.\n\n ***Unwavering.*** Nothing shall distract you from your mission. If you are magically compelled to desert your post, you do your utmost to resume your duty. Failing that, you take out your vengeance on the party responsible for your dereliction.\n\n##### Oath Spells\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Safeguarding Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.\n\n **Oath of Safeguarding Spells (table)**\n| Paladin Level  | Spells                                 | \n|----------------|----------------------------------------| \n| 3rd            | *longstrider,*, *shield of faith*      | \n| 5th            | *hold person*, *spike growth*          | \n| 9th            | *beacon of hope*, *spirit guardians*   | \n| 13th           | *dimension door*, *stoneskin*          | \n| 17th           | *greater restoration*, *wall of stone* |\n\n##### Channel Divinity\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.\n\n***Insurmountable Passage.*** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and stamp one foot on the ground. The ground within 60 feet of you magically becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. When you use this feature, you can designate up to 10 creatures that can ignore the difficult terrain.\n\n***Protect from Harm.*** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak reassuring words. For 1 minute, each friendly creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you has advantage on saving throws against spells and abilities that deal damage. In addition, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on its attack rolls until the end of its next turn.\n\n##### Aura of Preservation\nBeginning at 7th level, you emit an aura of safety while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction. The first time you or a friendly creature within the aura would take damage from a weapon attack between the end of your previous turn and the start of your next turn, the target of the attack has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, each friendly creature within the aura has advantage on death saving throws.\n  When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet, and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\n##### Battlefield Controller\nStarting at 15th level, you can't be shoved. When a hostile creature within 10 feet of you moves more than 10 feet away from you, you can use your reaction to move up to 10 feet and make an attack against that creature.\n\n##### Redoubtable Defender\nAt 20th level, as an action, you can touch your charge, typically a creature or structure, and create a magical link between you, which appears as a razor-thin, ghostly silver tether. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits: \n* You know the general status and well-being of your charge, such as if your charge is wounded or experiencing a particularly strong emotion, or, in the case of an object or structure, if it is damaged. \n* As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your charge, if it is a person or object. If the charge is a structure, you can choose to teleport to any unoccupied space within the structure. \n* You are immune to spells and effects that cause you to be charmed or might otherwise influence you to harm your charge. \n* If your charge is a creature and within 5 feet of you, the charge is immune to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it has advantage on all saving throws. \n* You can use an action to erect a barrier for 1 minute, similar to a *wall of force*, to protect your charge. The wall can be a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 5 feet, or four contiguous 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. If your charge is a structure, the barrier can cut through portions of the structure without harming it.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

Such paladins might also serve a genie, elemental deity, or other powerful elemental creature.\n\n##### Tenets of the Elements\nThough exact interpretations and words of the Oath of the Elements vary between those who serve the subtle, elemental spirits of the world and those who serve elemental deities or genies, paladins of this oath share these tenets.\n\n***Defend the Natural World.*** Every mountaintop, valley, cave, stream, and spring is sacred. You would fight to your last breath to protect natural places from harm.\n\n***Lead the Line.*** You stand at the forefront of every battle as a beacon of hope to lead your allies to victory.\n\n ***Act Wisely, Act Decisively.*** You weigh your actions carefully and offer counsel to those who would behave impulsively. When the time is right, you unleash the fury of the elements upon your enemies.\n\n ***Integrity.*** Your word is your bond. You don't lie or deceive others and always treat them with fairness.\n\n##### Oath Spells\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Elements Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.\n\n**Oath of the Elements Spells (table)**\n| Paladin Level  | Spells                                     | \n|----------------|--------------------------------------------| \n| 3rd            | *burning hands*, *thunderwave*            | \n| 5th            | *acid arrow*, *flaming sphere*             | \n| 9th            | *call lightning*, *protection from energy* | \n| 13th           | *conjure minor elementals*, *ice storm*    | \n| 17th           | *conjure elemental*, *wall of stone*       |\n\n##### Elemental Language\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you learn to speak, read, and write Primordial.\n\n##### Channel Divinity\nAt 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.\n\n***Abjure the Otherworldly.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to rebuke elementals and fiends. As an action, you present your holy symbol and recite ancient edicts from when the elements ruled the world. Each elemental or fiend that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\n  A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\n\n##### Elemental Strike.\nAs a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to magically imbue one weapon you are holding with the power of the elements. Choose air, earth, fire, or water. For 1 minute, you gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) on attacks made with the weapon. The type of damage is based on the element you chose: lightning or thunder (air), acid (earth), fire (fire), or cold (water). While your weapon is imbued with an element, you can choose to deal its damage type instead of radiant damage when you use your Divine Smite.\n  You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.\n\n##### Aura of Resistance\nBeginning at 7th level, your power over the elements forms a magical ward around you. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage when you finish a short or long rest. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage of this type. When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\n\n##### Elemental Companion\nAt 15th level, you can call upon the service of an elemental companion to aid you on your quests. As an action, you can summon an elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. The elemental is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys any verbal commands you issue to it. If you don't issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. It rolls its own initiative and has its own turns in combat.\n  You can have only one elemental companion at a time. If you summon a new one, the previous one disappears. In addition, you can't have a creature magically bound to you or your service, such as through the *conjure elemental* or *dominate person* spells or similar magic, while you have an elemental companion, but you can still have the willing service of a creature that isn't magically bound to you.\n  The elemental continues to serve you until you dismiss it as a bonus action or it is reduced to 0 hit points, which causes it to disappear. Once you summon an elemental companion, you can't summon another one until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Elemental Champion\nAt 20th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest the unchained power of the elements. Your eyes glow with fire, your hair and clothes move as if blown by a strong wind, droplets of rain float in a watery halo around you, and the ground trembles with your every step. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits: \n* You gain the flying speed of an air elemental (90 feet with hover), the Earth Glide trait and burrowing speed of an earth elemental (30 feet), or the swimming speed of a water elemental (90 feet). \n* You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage. \n* Any weapon you hold is imbued with the power of the elements. Choose an element, as with Elemental Strike. Your weapon deals an extra 3d6 damage to any creature you hit. The type of damage is based on the element you chose: lightning or thunder (air), acid (earth), fire (fire), or cold (water). While your weapon is imbued with an element, you can choose to deal its damage type in place of radiant damage when you use your Divine Smite.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

You must work to keep treasured people, objects, and communities safe.\n\n***Decisive Action.*** Threats to peaceful life are often nefarious and subtle.

As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). For 1 minute, each target has advantage on Strength, Constitution, and Charisma saving throws.\n\n ***Turn the Wild.*** As an action, you can cause wild creatures to flee from your presence using your Channel Divinity. Each creature within 30 feet of you with an Intelligence score of 4 or less that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\n  A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\n\n##### Aura of Awareness\nStarting at 7th level, allies around you are more alert and ready to act. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 10 feet of you can't be surprised except when incapacitated. When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\n\n##### Hold the Line\nAt 15th level, you can turn an ally's success into an opportunity. When a friendly creature you can see within 20 feet of you is forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to the target's saving throw. If the saving throw is successful, the target can make one weapon attack against the attacker as a reaction, provided the attacker is within the weapon's range.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Band of Heroes\nAt 20th level, you can charge your allies with divine heroism. As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see equal to your proficiency bonus, which can include yourself. Each target gains the following benefits for 1 minute: \n* The target is cured of all disease and poison and can't be frightened or poisoned. \n* The target has advantage on Wisdom and Constitution saving throws. \n* The target gains temporary hit points equal to your level.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

Ironically, paladins who follow this oath remain far from home in pursuit of their goals. Their oath reflects the welcoming warmth and light provided by the hearth, and paladins following the oath use these elements to turn away the cold or defeat enemies who employ cold as weapons.\n\n##### Tenets of the Hearth\nPaladins who take the Oath of the Hearth accommodate all creatures and attempt to find diplomatic solutions to conflicts. Once engaged in battle, though, these paladins fight until they defeat their enemies, or their enemies surrender. They rarely extend this peaceful stance to creatures who attack with cold or desire to spread cold conditions beyond natural confines.\n\n***Bastion of Peace.*** Reach out the hand of friendship when encountering strangers, and advocate for peace at the outset of any meeting. Encourage your companions to do likewise. When it becomes clear your opponents wish for violence, don't shrink away from combat.\n\n ***Beacon in the Dark.*** When winter comes and the nights increasingly lengthen, shine a welcoming light to which all people can rally. No creature shall prey on others under the cover of darkness while you are there.\n\n ***Hospitality of Home.*** Provide the comforts of home to those who meet with you peacefully. Respect others' cultures and traditions, provided they don't espouse aggression and violence toward others.\n\n ***Protection from the Elements.*** Ensure all people have shelter from the weather. Help during spring flooding, wintry blizzards, and when the blistering sun threatens heatstroke in the summer.\n\n ***Repel the Cold.*** Strive against foes that seek to bring eternal winter to the world or expand their icy domains into warmer climates. Understand the necessity of the changing of seasons and seek to banish only cold that is abnormal.\n\n##### Divine Sense\nIn addition to knowing the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead, your Divine Sense feature allows you to know the location of any cold creature within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover.\n\n##### Fiery Smite\nWhen you use your Divine Smite feature, you can choose for the extra damage you deal to be fire or radiant, and the extra damage increases to 1d8 only if the target is an undead or a cold creature.\n\n##### Oath Spells\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Hearth Spells table.

For 1 minute, each creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to attack another creature. A creature hostile to you has disadvantage on the saving throw. This effect ends on a creature if it is attacked or harmed by a spell.\n\n ***Turn Boreal Creatures.*** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak a prayer against unnatural cold. Each cold creature within 30 feet of you and that can see or hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\n  A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\n\n##### Aura of the Hearth\nBeginning at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that deal cold damage. If such a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a spell or effect that allows the creature to take only half the cold damage on a successful save, the creature instead takes no damage. In addition, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against the longterm effects of exposure to cold weather. When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\n\n##### Icewalker\nStarting at 15th level, you have resistance to cold damage, and you can't be restrained or petrified by cold or ice. In addition, you can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check, and difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost you extra movement.\n\n##### Roaring Fire\nAt 20th level, you can take on the aspects of a healthy, tended fire, radiating heat and light. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits: \n* You shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. \n* Whenever a cold creature starts its turn within 20 feet of you, the creature takes 2d8 fire damage, which ignores resistance and immunity to fire damage. \n* Whenever you cast a paladin spell that deals fire damage and has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it as a bonus action instead. \n* Your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 fire damage on a hit. If you deal fire damage to a cold creature, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute, or until it takes any damage.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

For 1 minute, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. In addition, each hostile creature within 5 feet of you has disadvantage on its first attack roll each turn that isn't against you. If the hostile creature is undead, it instead has disadvantage on all attack rolls that aren't against you. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you fall unconscious, this effect ends.\n\n ***Turn Undead.*** As an action, you present your holy symbol and call upon your power, using your Channel Divinity. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\n  A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\n\n##### Aura of Radiant Energy\nBeginning at 7th level, you and your allies within 10 feet of you have resistance to necrotic damage. In addition, when you or a friendly creature hit an undead creature within 10 feet of you with a melee weapon attack, the attacker can choose if the attack deals radiant damage or its normal type of damage. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\n\n##### Bulwark Against Death and Disease\nStarting at 15th level, you can expend only 1 hit point from your lay on hands pool to cure the target of a disease. In addition, your hit point maximum can't be reduced, and you have advantage on saving throws against effects from undead creatures that reduce your ability scores, such as a shadow's Strength Drain.\n\n##### Scourge of Undeath\nAt 20th level, as a bonus action, you can become a scourge to undead. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits: \n* The bright light shed by your Protective Aura is sunlight. \n* You have advantage on attack rolls against undead. \n* An undead creature in your Aura of Radiant Energy takes extra radiant damage equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) when you or a friendly creature hit it with a melee weapon attack.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",
