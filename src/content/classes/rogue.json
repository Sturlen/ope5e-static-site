    "desc": "### Expertise \n \nAt 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. \n \nAt 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit. \n \n### Sneak Attack \n \nBeginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. \n \nYou don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. \n \nThe amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. \n \n### Thieves' Cant \n \nDuring your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. \n \nIn addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. \n \n### Cunning Action \n \nStarting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. \n \n### Roguish Archetype \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Uncanny Dodge \n \nStarting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you. \n \n### Evasion \n \nBeginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an *ice storm* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. \n \n### Reliable Talent \n \nBy 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. \n \n### Blindsense \n \nStarting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. \n \n### Slippery Mind \n \nBy 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. \n \n### Elusive \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated. \n \n### Stroke of Luck \n \nAt 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. \n \n### Roguish Archetypes \n \nRogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus-not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.",

Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ. \n \n##### Fast Hands \n \nStarting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action. \n \n##### Second-Story Work \n \nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement. \n \nIn addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier. \n \n##### Supreme Sneak \n \nStarting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn. \n \n##### Use Magic Device \n \nBy 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items. \n \n##### Thief's Reflexes \n \nWhen you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.",

            "name": "Cat Burglar",
            "slug": "cat-burglar",
            "desc": "As a cat burglar, you've honed your ability to enter closed or restricted areas, drawing upon a tradition first developed among the catfolk, who often are innately curious and driven to learn what wonders, riches, or unusual friends and foes lie beyond their reach or just out of sight. In ages past, some allowed this inquisitiveness to guide them toward a rogue's life devoted to bridging that gap by breaking into any and all structures, dungeons, or walled-off regions that prevented them from satisfying their curiosity.\n\nSo successful were these first catfolk burglars that other rogues soon began emulating their techniques. Walls become but minor inconveniences once you work out the best methods of scaling them and learn to mitigate injuries from falls. In time, cat burglars become adept at breaching any openings they find; after all, if a door was not meant to be opened, why would it have been placed there? Those who devote a lifetime to such endeavors eventually learn to spot and bypass even the cleverest traps and hidden doors, including those disguised or warded by magic.\n\nSome cat burglars use their abilities to help themselves to the contents of treasure vaults or uncover hidden secrets, others become an integral part of an adventuring party that values skillful infiltration techniques, and still others get the jump on their foes by taking the fight to them where and when they least expect it, up to and including private bed chambers or inner sanctums. You'll likely end up someplace you're not supposed to be, but those are the places most worth visiting!\n\n##### Up, Over, and In\nBeginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. If you already have a climbing speed equal to or greater than your walking speed, it increases by 5 feet. In addition, when you are falling, you can use your reaction to soften the fall. You reduce the falling damage you take by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus + your rogue level. You don't land prone, unless the damage you take from the fall would reduce you to less than half your hit point maximum.\n\n##### Artful Dodger\nAt 3rd level, alert to the dangers posed by hidden traps and wards, you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist a trap or a magic effect with a trigger, such as the *glyph of warding* spell, and you have resistance to the damage dealt by such effects.\n\n##### Cat's Eye\nStarting at 9th level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to find or disarm traps, locate secret or hidden doors, discern the existence of an illusion, or spot a *glyph of warding*. You can also search for traps while traveling at a normal pace, instead of only while at a slow pace.\n\n##### Breaking and Entering\nAt 13th level, when you make an attack against a door, gate, window, shutters, bars, or similar object or structure that is blocking or barring an egress, you have advantage on the attack roll, and you can add your Sneak Attack damage on a hit. You can choose for this damage to be audible out to a range of 100 feet or to be audible only within 5 feet of the point where you hit the object or structure. Similarly, you can choose for this damage to appear more or less impactful than it actually is, such as neatly carving a hole for you to squeeze through a wall or window or bursting a door off its hinges.\n\nYour expertise at deftly dismantling crafted works extends to constructs and undead. You don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack feature against constructs and undead. As normal, you can't use Sneak Attack if you have disadvantage on the attack roll.\n\n##### Master Burglar\nAt 17th level, you can slip past a fire-breathing statue unscathed or tread lightly enough to not set off a pressure plate. The first time on each of your turns 118 that you would trigger a trap or magic effect with a trigger, such as the *glyph of warding* spell, you can choose to not trigger it.\n  As a bonus action, you can choose a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus that you can see within 30 feet of you and grant them the effects of this feature for 1 hour. Once you grant this feature to others, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.",

Dawn blades are devout rogues, drawing divine power from deities of light to strike as a sudden ray of searing sunlight in the darkness. They are often considered controversial by other adherents of their faith, yet the faith's leadership understands such agents are sometimes necessary.\n\n##### Eyes of the Dawn\nAt 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet.\n\n##### Dawn Strike\nStarting at 3rd level, when you deal damage with your Sneak Attack feature, you can magically change the extra damage dealt to radiant damage. When you hit an undead or a creature of shadow with such a Sneak Attack, you deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage.\n\n##### Radiant Beam\nBeginning at 3rd level, when you deal radiant damage to a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to throw a portion of that radiant energy at a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged weapon attack against the second creature. You are proficient with this beam, and you don't have disadvantage on the ranged attack roll from being within 5 feet of the first creature (though you can still have disadvantage from other sources). On a hit, the beam deals 1d6 radiant damage.\n  When you reach 10th level in this class, the beam's damage increases to 2d6.\n\n##### Bolstering Light\nStarting at 9th level, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with radiant damage, choose one of the following: \n* Gain temporary hit points equal to twice your rogue level for 1 hour. \n* End one condition affecting you. The condition can be blinded, deafened, or poisoned. \n* End one curse affecting you. \n* End one disease affecting you.\n\n##### Sudden Illumination\nAt 13th level, when you hit a creature with your Radiant Beam, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or be blinded until the end of its next turn.\n\n##### Dawn Flare\nAt 17th level, when you use your Dawn Strike feature to deal radiant damage to a creature that can't see you, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 radiant damage and can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Once a creature takes damage from this feature, it is immune to your Dawn Flare for 24 hours.",

Sappers are deployed with the soldiery to dig trenches, build bridges, and breach defenses. When troops move into a heavily defended area, it's your job to make it happen as efficiently as possible.\n\n##### Combat Engineer\nWhen you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in alchemist's supplies, carpenter's tools, mason's tools, and tinker's tools. Using these tools, you can do or create the following.\n\n***Alchemical Bomb.*** As an action, you can mix together volatile chemicals into an explosive compound and throw it at a point you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier), taking 1d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Alchemical bombs lose their potency and become inert 1 minute after they are created.\n  If a construct fails the saving throw or if you throw the bomb at a structure or an object that isn't being worn or carried, your bomb also deals your Sneak Attack damage to the target.\n  When you reach certain levels in this class, the bomb's damage increases: at 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).\n\n***Jury Rig Fortification.*** You are adept at creating fortifications with whatever materials are at hand. With 1 minute of work, you can create one of the following. Your ability to use this option might be limited by the available building materials or if the ground is too hard to work, at the GM's discretion. \n* Create a low wall that is large enough to provide half cover to a Medium creature. \n* Dig a 5-foot-long, 3-foot-wide trench to a depth of 3 feet. \n* Build a 5-foot-long, 3-foot-wide ladder. Each additional minute spent on this option increases the length of the ladder by 5 feet. The ladder is sturdy enough to be used as a bridge.\n\n***Hastily Trap an Area.*** You can create and set some types of traps quickly. The Creating Traps table indicates the timeframes required to build and deploy commonly used traps. At the GM's discretion, you can use this feature to make and use other types of traps.\n\n**Creating Traps (table)**\n| Type of Trap        | Time Required to Build Trap                             | Time Required to Set Trap              | \n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------| \n| **Collapsing Roof** | 5 minutes for each 5-foot-by-5-foot section             | When you finish building this trap, it is considered set. | \n| **Falling Net**     | 1 minute                                                | 1 action                               | \n| **Hunting Trap**    | 1 minute                                                | 1 bonus action                         | \n| **Pit**             | 5 minutes for a 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep simple pit<br/>15 minutes for a 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep hidden pit<br/>1 hour for a 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep locking pit;<br/>to add spikes to a pit, increase the time by 1 minute.     | When you finish building this trap, it is considered set.<br/>It requires 1 bonus action to reset a simple pit or locking pit<br/>1 action to reset a hidden pit.|\n\n##### Sculpt Terrain\nAt 3rd level, when you throw your alchemical bomb, you can choose for the bomb to not deal damage. If you do so, the area within 10 feet of the point of impact becomes difficult terrain. You don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature, if the creature is within the difficult terrain created by your alchemical bomb.\n\n##### Breach Defenses\nStarting at 9th level, when you hit a structure or an object that isn't being worn or carried, your attack treats the structure or object as if its damage threshold is 5 lower. For example, if you hit a door that has a damage threshold of 10, its damage threshold is considered 5 when determining if your attack's damage meets or exceeds its threshold. If a structure or object doesn't have a damage threshold or if this feature would allow you to treat its damage threshold as 0 or lower, your attack also deals your Sneak Attack damage to the target.\n  When you reach certain levels in this class, the damage threshold your attacks can ignore increases: at 13th level (10) and 17th level (15).\n\n##### Clear the Path\nAt 13th level, you have advantage on checks to disarm traps. If you fail a check made to disarm a trap, the trap doesn't trigger even if its description states otherwise. In addition, you can disarm a trap as a bonus action.\n\n##### All Clear\nBeginning at 17th level, you can use an action to declare a 50-foot-square area safe for travel for 1 minute. Mechanical and magical traps in the area don't trigger for the duration. In addition, difficult terrain in the area doesn't cost you or any creatures you designate who can see or hear you extra movement when moving through it. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

            "desc": "The transport of goods, creatures, and even people can be a lucrative business, particularly if you know how to avoid expensive import and export taxes, bridge, highway, and port tolls, and other legal requirements. Exotic poisons from far-off locales, banned or cursed magic items, and illicit drugs or bootleg liquor all fetch a high price on the black market. Thieves- guilds, pirates, and criminal kingpins pay well to those who can avoid law enforcement when moving stolen goods, provide safe channels of communication, break associates free from jail cells or dungeons, or deliver supplies past guards. You-ve become adept at all of these things, perhaps even having developed a network of contacts as a criminal, noble, con artist, or sailor during an earlier part of your life.\n\n##### Dab-handed Dealer\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with vehicles (land and water) and with your choice of either the disguise kit or navigator-s tools. Moreover, when determining your carrying capacity, you are considered one size category larger than your actual size.\n  Starting at this level, you also have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to hide objects on vehicles, and you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a check to control a vehicle, or to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to conceal a light weapon on yourself, opposed by the Wisdom (Perception) checks of creatures within 5 feet of you; if you succeed on a check to conceal a weapon in this way, then you have advantage on your next attack against one of those creatures using that weapon, including on ranged attacks even if the target is within 5 feet of you.\n\n##### Smuggler-s Legerdemain\nAlso at 3rd level, having made a careful study of laws and those who enforce them, you-ve become adept at avoiding both, even mastering a handful of arcane techniques that aid your smuggling activities. You learn two cantrips at this level and, when you reach 7th level in this class, one 1st-level spell of your choice. The cantrips and spell must be from among the illusion or transmutation spells on the wizard spell list, all of which are ideally suited for manipulating goods, duping guards, communicating with covert contacts, or escaping from a failed heist. Having learned these forms of magic through research and rote memorization, Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.\n  You can cast the cantrips at will and the spell once at its lowest level; you must finish a long rest before casting the spell again in this way. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.\n  Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace the 1st-level spell with another 1st-level spell of your choice from among the illusion or transmutation spells on the wizard spell list.\n\n##### Hypervigilance\nStarting at 9th level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or hearing, and you can-t be surprised while you are conscious. In addition, you have developed an awareness for avoiding social or legal entrapment, and you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to discern loopholes and traps in legal documents and on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern when you are being manipulated into a bad social or legal situation.\n\n##### Improved Smuggler-s Legerdemain\nAt 13th level, to further facilitate your extralegal activities, you learn a second illusion or transmutation spell, which must be one of the following: *arcanist-s magic aura*, *blur*, *darkvision*, *enlarge/reduce*, *invisibility*, *knock*, *levitate*, *magic mouth*, *mirror image*, *rope trick*, or *spider climb*. Intelligence is again your spellcasting ability for this spell. You can cast this spell once at its lowest level and must finish a long rest before you can cast it again in this way. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of 2nd-level or higher. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace a spell from this list with another from this list.\n  In addition, beginning at 13th level, whenever you cast one of your 1st-level Smuggler-s Legerdemain spells, you always cast it as if using a 2nd-level spell slot unless you choose to cast it using a spell slot you have of a different level.\n\n##### Slippery as an Eel\nStarting at 17th level, you have become especially adept at slipping away from the authorities and getting a jump on foes, even when encumbered by illicit goods. Your speed increases by 10 feet, you ignore difficult terrain, and you have advantage on initiative rolls.",

Soulspies are agents of the divine who lurk in the shadows, taking a less-visible role in the fight. Occasionally, they aid other agents of their deities, but most often they locate and manage or eliminate threats to their deities that more scrupulous agents might be unwilling or unable to handle.\n\n##### Spellcasting\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells drawn from the magic of a divine entity.\n\n##### Cantrips\nYou learn three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn another cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.\n\n**Soulspy Spellcasting**\n| Rouge Level  | Cantrips Known | Spells Unknown | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | \n|--------------|----------------|----------------------|-----|-----|-----| \n| 3rd          | 3              | 3              | 2   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 4th          | 3              | 4              | 3   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 5th          | 3              | 4              | 3   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 6th          | 3              | 4              | 3   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 7th          | 3              | 5              | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | \n| 8th          | 3              | 6              | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | \n| 9th          | 3              | 6              | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | \n| 10th         | 4              | 7              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | \n| 11th         | 4              | 8              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | \n| 12th         | 4              | 8              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | \n| 13th         | 4              | 9              | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \n| 14th         | 4              | 10             | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \n| 15th         | 4              | 10             | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \n| 16th         | 4              | 11             | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | \n| 17th         | 4              | 11             | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | \n| 18th         | 4              | 11             | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | \n| 19th         | 4              | 12             | 4   | 3   | 3   | 1   | \n| 20th         | 4              | 13             | 4   | 3   | 3   | 1   |\n\n##### Spell Slots\nThe Soulspy Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend one of these slots at the spell-s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell *inflict wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *inflict wounds* using either slot.\n\n##### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher\nYou know three 1st-level cleric spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and necromancy spells on the cleric spell list. The Spells Known column of the Soulspy Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or necromancy spell and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can be from any school of magic.\n  When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cleric spells you know and replace it with another spell from the cleric spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or necromancy spell, unless you-re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level.\n\n##### Spellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. You learn your spells through meditation and prayer to the powerful forces that guide your actions. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n##### Bonus Proficiency\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Religion skill, if you don-t already have it. \n\n##### Divine Symbol\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use an action to create a symbol of your deity that hovers within 5 feet of you. The symbol is a Tiny object that is visible but invulnerable and intangible, and it lasts for 1 minute, until you die, or until you dismiss it (no action required). While this symbol is active, you gain the following benefits: \n* Your Divine Symbol functions as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. \n* As a bonus action, you can turn the symbol into thieves- tools, which you can use to pick locks, disarm traps, or any other activities that would normally require such tools. While your Divine Symbol is functioning in this way, it loses all other properties listed here. You can change it from thieves- tools back to its symbol form as a bonus action. \n* The symbol sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action. When you extinguish the symbol-s light, you can also snuff out one candle, torch, or other nonmagical light source within 10 feet of you. \n* When you create this symbol, and as an action on each of your turns while the symbol is active, you can force the symbol to shoot divine energy at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice). When you reach certain levels in this class, the symbol-s damage increases: at 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\n\n##### Sacred Stealth\nStarting at 9th level, you can use your Sneak Attack on a creature hit by an attack with your Divine Symbol if the target of the attack is within 5 feet of an ally, that ally isn-t incapacitated, and you don-t have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Touching the Soul\nWhen you reach 13th level, you can use your Divine Symbol to deliver your cleric spells that have a range of touch. Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you as the target of the spell. You can-t use your Sacred Stealth feature on a spell delivered in this way. After you cast the spell, your Divine Symbol ends.\n  In addition, when you cast a spell that deals radiant or necrotic damage, you can switch it to do the other type of damage instead.\n\n##### Life Thief\nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to magically channel life force energy out of one creature and into another. When you deal radiant or necrotic damage with your Divine Symbol attack or a cleric spell or cantrip, choose a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to half the radiant or necrotic damage dealt. You can target yourself with this feature. Once you use this feature, you can-t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

These Underfoot use druidic magic and their natural aptitude for burrowing to defend their forest homes. The Underfoot are an elite order of burrow warriors in every erina colony.

The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a divination or transmutation spell, unless you-re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level.\n\n##### Spellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. Your magic draws upon your connection with the natural world. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.\n\n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.\n\n**Underfoot Spellcasting (table)**\n| Rouge Level  | Cantrips Known | Spells Unknown | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | \n|--------------|----------------|----------------------|-----|-----|-----| \n| 3rd          | 3              | 3              | 2   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 4th          | 3              | 4              | 3   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 5th          | 3              | 4              | 3   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 6th          | 3              | 4              | 3   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 7th          | 3              | 5              | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | \n| 8th          | 3              | 6              | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | \n| 9th          | 3              | 6              | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | \n| 10th         | 4              | 7              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | \n| 11th         | 4              | 8              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | \n| 12th         | 4              | 8              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | \n| 13th         | 4              | 9              | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \n| 14th         | 4              | 10             | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \n| 15th         | 4              | 10             | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \n| 16th         | 4              | 11             | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | \n| 17th         | 4              | 11             | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | \n| 18th         | 4              | 11             | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | \n| 19th         | 4              | 12             | 4   | 3   | 3   | 1   | \n| 20th         | 4              | 13             | 4   | 3   | 3   | 1   |\n\n##### Versatile Shillelagh\nBeginning at 3rd level, when you cast *shillelagh*, the spell is modified in the following ways: \n* Its duration increases to 1 hour. \n* The spell ends early only if another creature holds the weapon or if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. \n* Your Sneak Attack feature can be applied to attack rolls made with your *shillelagh* weapon.\n\n##### Undermine\nBeginning at 9th level, you can use your action to dig a hole under a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or fall prone. If the target fails its saving throw, you can make one weapon attack against that target as a bonus action.\n\n##### Death From Below\nBeginning at 13th level, when you move at least 10 feet underground toward a target, your next attack against the target with your *shillelagh* weapon has advantage.\n\n##### Vicious\nAt 17th level, when you use your Death From Below feature and hit the target with your *shillelagh* weapon, the target is restrained by vegetation and soil until the end of its next turn.",
