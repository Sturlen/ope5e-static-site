    "desc": "### Favored Enemy \n \nBeginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy. \n \nChoose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies. \n \nYou have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. \n \nWhen you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all. \n \nYou choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures. \n \n### Natural Explorer \n \nYou are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in. \n \nWhile traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits: \n* Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel. \n* Your group can't become lost except by magical means. \n* Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. \n* If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. \n* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. \n* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. \n \nYou choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level. \n \n### Fighting Style \n \nAt 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. \n \n#### Archery \n \nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. \n \n#### Defense \n \nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. \n \n#### Dueling \n \nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. \n \n#### Two-Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. \n \n### Spellcasting \n \nBy the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list. \n \n#### Spell Slots \n \nThe Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell *animal friendship* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *animal friendship* using either slot. \n \n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \n \nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. \n \nThe Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n### Ranger Archetype \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. \n \n### Primeval Awareness \n \nBeginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Land's Stride \n \nStarting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. \n \nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* spell. \n \n### Hide in Plain Sight \n \nStarting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage. \n \nOnce you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit. \n \n### Vanish \n \nStarting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail. \n \n### Feral Senses \n \nAt 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. \n \nYou are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened. \n \n### Foe Slayer \n \nAt 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.",

As you walk the Hunter's path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons. \n \n##### Hunter's Prey \n \nAt 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. \n \n**_Colossus Slayer._** Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn. \n \n**_Giant Killer._** When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature. \n \n**_Horde Breaker._** Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon. \n \n##### Defensive Tactics \n \nAt 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. \n \n**_Escape the Horde._** Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage. \n \n**_Multiattack Defense._** When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn. \n \n**_Steel Will._** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. \n \n##### Multiattack \n \nAt 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. \n \n**_Volley._** You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target. \n \n**_Whirlwind Attack._** You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. \n \n##### Superior Hunter's Defense \n \nAt 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. \n \n**_Evasion._** When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a *lightning bolt* spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. \n \n**_Stand Against the Tide._** When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice. \n \n**_Uncanny Dodge._** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.",

You also train them to recognize and obey your allies when you aren't able to direct them. While a beast trainer can train any type of animal, they often generate a strong bond with one species and focus their training on beasts of that type.\n\n##### Beast Whisperer\nStarting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Animal Handling. If you already have proficiency in this skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it.\n\n##### Trained Animals\nBeginning when you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a beast companion. Choose a beast that is Medium or smaller and has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. The beast is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys any commands that you issue to it. In combat, it shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. The beast can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics.\n\nIf you are knocked unconscious, killed, or otherwise unable to command your trained animal, one of your allies can use a bonus action to command it by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.\n\nWhen you reach 7th level, you can have more than one trained animal at a time. All your trained animals can have a total challenge rating equal to a quarter of your level, rounded down. A beast with a challenge rating of 0 is considered to have a challenge rating of 1/8 for the purpose of determining the number of trained animals you can have. You can use a bonus action to direct all your trained animals to take the same action, or you can use an action to command all of them to take different actions.\n\nTo have one or more trained animals, you must spend at least one hour each day practicing commands and playing with your animals, which you can do during a long rest.\n\nIf a trained animal dies, you can use an action to touch the animal and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The animal returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.\n\n##### Bestial Flanker\nAt 7th level, when you hit a creature, you can choose one of your trained animals you can see within 30 feet of you. If that trained animal attacks the creature you hit before your next turn, it has advantage on its first attack roll.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Bred for Battle\nStarting at 11th level, add half your proficiency bonus to each trained animal's AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and to any skills in which it is proficient, and increase each trained animal's hit point maximum by twice your proficiency bonus. In addition, you can choose Large and smaller beasts when you select trained animals.\n\n##### Primal Whirlwind\nAt 15th level, when you command your trained animals to use the Attack action, you can choose for one trained animal to attack all creatures within 5 feet of it, making one attack against each creature.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",

In return for their diligent protection, the forests offer their blessings to dedicated alseid rangers. In recent years, woodsy adventurers of other races who have earned the forests' trust also received this blessing, though their numbers are scant. These Grove Wardens can tap into the living magic of ancient forests. Your senses travel through the plants and earth of the woods, and the very land rises up to strike down your enemies.\n\n##### Grove Warden Magic\nStarting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Grove Warden Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.\n\n**Grove Warden Spells**\n| Ranger Level  | Spells                  | \n|---------------|-------------------------| \n| 3rd           | *entangle*              | \n| 5th           | *branding smite*        | \n| 9th           | *speak with plants*     | \n| 13th          | *hallucinatory terrain* | \n| 17th          | *animate objects*       |\n\n##### Whispers of the Forest\nAt 3rd level, when you use your Primeval Awareness feature while within a forest, you add humanoids to the list of creature types you can sense. When sensing humanoids, you know the general direction of the creatures, and you know if a humanoid is solitary, in a small group of up to 5 humanoids, or a pack of more than 5 humanoids.\n\n##### Forest's Will\nAt 3rd level, you can magically draw on the living essence of the land to hamper your foes. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Your next weapon attack against that creature has advantage. If that attack hits, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. When you reach 11th level in this class, if that attack hits, the creature's speed is instead halved until the start of your next turn.\n\n##### Intruder's Bane\nAt 7th level, you can command the land around you to come to your aid. As a bonus action, choose a point you can see on the ground within 60 feet. You cause the area within 15 feet of that point to undulate and warp. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature is pushed up to 15 feet in a direction of your choice and knocked prone. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Wrath of the Forest\nAt 11th level, you can call on the land in your vicinity to strike at your enemies. When you take the Attack action, you can use a bonus action to make a rock, branch, root, or other small natural object attack a creature within 30 feet of you. You are proficient with the attack, it counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and you add your Dexterity modifier to the attack and damage rolls. The damage is of a type appropriate to the object, such as piercing for a thorny branch or bludgeoning for a rock, and the damage die is a d8.\n\n##### Living Bulwark\nStarting at 15th level, the land around you comes to your aid when you are in danger, interposing rocks, branches, vines, roots, or even the ground itself between you and your foes. When a creature you can see targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to roll a d8 and add it to your AC against the attack.",

Haunted wardens are rangers who have come face to face with the restless spirit of one of those lost wanderers. Somehow during the course of this meeting, the yearning phantom tethers its spirit to the warden's in order to put its unfinished business to rest. Even after its final wishes are met, or in the tragic instance they can't come to fruition, your companion remains with you until you meet your end, both as a constant confidante and a reminder that the veil between life and death is thin indeed.\n\n##### Beyond the Pale\nStarting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to see into the Ethereal Plane for 1 minute. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Haunted Warden Magic\nYou learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Haunted Warden Spells table.

The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See the spirit's game statistics in the Spirit Usher stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.\n\nYou determine the spirit's appearance, name, and personality. You should choose a personality trait, ideal, bond, and flaw for it, and you should work with your GM to decide on a background story for the spirit that fits the campaign.\n  In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.\n  When it joins with you, the spirit learns three cantrips it can cast at will, which you select from the following lists. At the end of a long rest, you can change which cantrips the spirit knows. \n* Choose one of *chill touch*, *ray of frost*, *sacred flame*, or *vicious mockery*. Use your level when determining the damage of the chosen cantrip. \n* Choose one of *druidcraft*, *prestidigitation*, or *thaumaturgy*. \n* Choose one of *dancing lights*, *message*, or *minor illusion*.\nThe spirit is bonded to you. It can't be turned or destroyed, such as with the cleric's Turn Undead feature. When the spirit usher dies, it retreats to the Ethereal Plane to restore itself and returns to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you when you finish a long rest. If the spirit usher died within the last hour, you can use your action to expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to return it to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.\n\n##### Merge Spirit\nStarting at 7th level, you can use an action to cause your spirit usher to join its essence with you for 1 minute. While merged, you gain the spirit usher's Ethereal Sight trait and can interact with creatures and objects on both the Ethereal and Material Planes. In addition, while you are merged, you become less substantial and gain the spirit usher's damage resistances and damage immunities.\n  Once you use this feature, you shouldn't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Each time you use it again, you suffer one level of exhaustion.\n\n##### Guardian Geist\nAt 11th level, when you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to call out to your spirit usher. If you do, your spirit usher teleports to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you and takes half the damage dealt to you, potentially preventing your death.\n  In addition, when your spirit usher dies, you have advantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn.\n\n##### True Psychopomp\nAt 15th level, you can use your Merge Sprit feature as a bonus action instead of an action. When you and your spirit usher merge forms, you gain its Incorporeal Movement trait and Etherealness action, and you are considered to be undead for the purposes of determining whether or not spells or other magical effects can affect you.",

            "desc": "Like the serpents they adore, snake speakers are highly adaptable hunters. Snakes are common throughout the world, and people who need to travel through snake-filled jungles often retain a snake speaker guide, trusting the guide to protect them from scaly poisoners.\n\n##### Snake Speaker Magic\nStarting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Snake Speaker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.\n\n**Snake Speaker Spells**\n| Ranger Level  | Spells            | \n|---------------|-------------------| \n| 3rd           | *charm person*    | \n| 5th           | *suggestion*      | \n| 9th           | *tongues*         | \n| 13th          | *confusion*       | \n| 17th          | *dominate person* |\n\n##### Scaly Transition\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can take on limited serpentine aspects. When you finish a long rest, select one of the following features. You gain the benefit of the chosen feature until the next time you finish a long rest. Starting at 11th level, you can select two options when you finish a long rest.\n\n***Bite.*** You develop venomous fangs. When you use the Attack action and attack with a weapon, you can use a bonus action to bite a target within 5 feet of you with your fangs. You are proficient with the fangs, which deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) plus 1d8 poison damage on a hit.\n\n***Keen Smell.*** Your nose and olfactory organs change to resemble those belonging to a snake. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on scent and on Wisdom (Insight) checks.\n\n***Poison Resistance.*** You have resistance to poison damage.\n\n***Scales.*** Scales sprout along your body. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\n\n***Serpentine Movement.*** You have a climbing speed of 30 feet.\n\n##### Speak with Snakes\nStarting at 3rd level, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with snakes. A snake's knowledge and awareness are limited by its Intelligence, but it can give you information about things it has perceived within the last day. You can persuade a snake to perform small favors for you, such as carrying a written message to a nearby companion.\n\n##### Serpent Shape\nWhen you reach 7th level, you can use an action to cast *polymorph* on yourself, assuming the shape of a giant constrictor snake, flying snake, or giant poisonous snake. While you are in the form of a snake, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n  Starting at 15th level, you retain the benefits of your Scaly Transition feature while in the form of a snake, and you can use this feature twice between rests.\n\n##### Sinuous Dance\nBeginning at 11th level, your physical movements can beguile your enemies and strengthen your magic. You can choose to use Dexterity as your spellcasting ability score instead of Wisdom.\n  In addition, when you cast a spell, you can add your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers together and use the result as your spellcasting ability modifier when determining the DC or spell attack bonus for that spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Decoy Skin\nStarting at 15th level, you learn to magically shed your skin and use it as an animate decoy. As an action, you can shed your skin, which creates a duplicate of yourself. The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. It looks like you, has your Armor Class and saving throw bonuses, and has hit points equal to three times your ranger level. It lasts for 10 minutes or until it is reduced to 0 hit points.\n  As a bonus action, you can command it to move up to your speed, using any form of movement you possess, but it must remain within 120 feet of you. Your decoy can't take actions or use your class features, but it otherwise moves as directed. While your decoy is within 5 feet of you, its appearance and movements so closely mimic yours that when a creature that can reach you and your decoy makes an attack against you, it has a 50 percent change of hitting your decoy instead.\n  It looks exactly as you looked when you used this feature, and it is a convincing duplicate of you. A creature can discern that it isn't you with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

            "desc": "The alseid have long defended the limits of their forest homes. These warriors can make a dizzying variety of ranged and melee attacks in quick succession, using ancient magic to flash across the battlefield.\n\n##### Restriction: Alseid\nYou can choose this archetype only if you are an alseid.\n\n##### Weald Spear\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to call forth a magical, wooden spear from the land of fey into your empty hand as a bonus action. The spear disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You are proficient with the weapon while you wield it. The spear's range is 20/60 feet, and, when you throw the spear, it reappears in your hand after the attack. The spear's damage die is a d8, and it has the finesse and reach properties.\n  At 7th level, your weald spear attack counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and your weald spear's damage die is a d10. At 11th level, your weald spear's damage die is a d12.\n\n##### Touch of the Fey Land\nThe touch of the land of the fey is always on your spear, hinting at its otherworldly ties. Beginning at 3rd level, when you summon your weald spear, choose one of the following effects.\n\n***Aflame.*** Your spear is ensorcelled in heatless, white, magical flames whose intensity rise and fall to reflect your mood. When you are at your happiest, your spear sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.\n\n***Entwined.*** Your spear appears to be wrapped in writhing green vines which occasionally coalesce into the shape of a slender, grasping hand. The hand always points in the direction of your home forest.\n\n***Everblooming.*** Your spear is covered in small wildflowers that bloom, die, bud, and bloom again within minutes. Pollinating insects are often drawn to your spear as the spear constantly exudes a pleasant, floral fragrance.\n\n***Moonlit.*** Your spear appears as a pale length of wooden moonlight. A trail of star-like motes travels behind the spear's point.\n\n##### Canopy\nBeginning at 7th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you, including yourself, is targeted by a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to summon a magical canopy of glowing leaves and branches over the target. The target has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack, and the canopy bursts into shredded leaves afterwards. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Canopy again.\n  When you reach 11th level in this class, you can use your Canopy twice between rests, and at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all expended uses.\n\n##### Steps of the Forest God\n Starting at 11th level, after you make a successful ranged weapon attack with your weald spear, you can use a bonus action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of your target.\n\n##### Overwhelm\nAt 15th level, after you make a successful melee weapon attack with your weald spear against a creature, you can use a bonus action to make one ranged weapon attack with it against a different creature. You don't have disadvantage on the ranged attack roll from being within 5 feet of the first creature you hit, however, you can still have disadvantage on the attack roll from being within 5 feet of other creatures.",

You patrol its boundaries and stride unseen through its harsh landscape, evading danger and protecting those who find themselves at the mercy of the arcana-laced wilds and eldritch horrors.\n\n##### Chaotic Strikes\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you've learned to channel the unpredictable energies of magical wastelands into your weapon attacks. You can use a bonus action to imbue your weapon with chaotic energy for 1 minute. Roll a d8 and consult the Chaotic Strikes table to determine which type of energy is imbued in your weapon. While your weapon is imbued with chaotic energy, it deals an extra 1d4 damage of the imbued type to any target you hit with it. If you are no longer holding or carrying the weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.\n\n**Chaotic Strikes**\n| d8 | Damage Type | \n|----|-------------| \n| 1  | Fire        | \n| 2  | Cold        | \n| 3  | Lightning   | \n| 4  | Psychic     | \n| 5  | Necrotic    | \n| 6  | Poison      | \n| 7  | Radiant     | \n| 8  | Force       |\n\n##### Wasteland Strider Magic\nAlso starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Wasteland Strider Spells table.

You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened and on ability checks and saving throws to discern illusions.\n\n##### Call the Otherworldly\nAt 11th level, you've gained some control over otherworldly beings. You can use an action to summon a fiend or aberration with a challenge rating of 2 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. It disappears after 1 hour, when you are incapacitated, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.\n  The otherworldly being is friendly to you and your companions. In combat, roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the otherworldly being, it attacks the creature you are attacking, or defends itself from hostile creatures if you aren't attacking a creature, but otherwise takes no actions.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 17th level in this class, you can summon a fiend or aberration with a challenge rating of 5 or lower with this feature.\n\n##### Dimensional Step\nAt 15th level, you have learned to slip briefly between worlds. You can cast the *dimension door* spell without expending a spell slot. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",
