{"name":"Druid","slug":"druid","desc":"### Druidic \n \nYou know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic. \n \n### Spellcasting \n \nDrawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. \n \n### Wild Shape \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. \n \nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed. \n \n**Beast Shapes (table)** \n \n| Level | Max. CR | Limitations                 | Example     | \n|-------|---------|-----------------------------|-------------| \n| 2nd   | 1/4     | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf        | \n| 4th   | 1/2     | No flying speed             | Crocodile   | \n| 8th   | 1       | -                           | Giant eagle | \n \nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. \n \nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply: \n \n* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them. \n* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious. \n* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you've already cast. \n* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. \n* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. \n \n### Druid Circle \n \nAt 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Timeless Body \n \nStarting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. \n \n### Beast Spells \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components. \n \n### Archdruid \n \nAt 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. \n \nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.","hit_dice":"1d8","hp_at_1st_level":"8 + your Constitution modifier","hp_at_higher_levels":"1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st","prof_armor":"Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)","prof_weapons":"Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears","prof_tools":"Herbalism kit","prof_saving_throws":"Intelligence, Wisdom","prof_skills":"Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival","equipment":"You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: \n \n* (*a*) a wooden shield or (*b*) any simple weapon \n* (*a*) a scimitar or (*b*) any simple melee weapon \n* Leather armor, an explorer's pack, and a druidic focus","table":"| Level | Proficiency Bonus | Features                                          | Cantrips Known | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | \n|-------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----| \n| 1st   | +2                | Druidic, Spellcasting                             | 2              | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 2nd   | +2                | Wild Shape, Druid Circle                          | 2              | 3   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 3rd   | +2                | -                                                 | 2              | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 4th   | +2                | Wild Shape Improvement, Ability Score Improvement | 3              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 5th   | +3                | -                                                 | 3              | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 6th   | +3                | Druid Circle feature                              | 3              | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 7th   | +3                | -                                                 | 3              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 1   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 8th   | +3                | Wild Shape Improvement, Ability Score Improvement | 3              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 9th   | +4                | -                                                 | 3              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 1   | -   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 10th  | +4                | Druid Circle feature                              | 4              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 11th  | +4                | -                                                 | 4              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 12th  | +4                | Ability Score Improvement                         | 4              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 13th  | +5                | -                                                 | 4              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 1   | -   | -   | \n| 14th  | +5                | Druid Circle feature                              | 4              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 1   | -   | -   | \n| 15th  | +5                | -                                                 | 4              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 1   | 1   | -   | \n| 16th  | +5                | Ability Score Improvement                         | 4              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 1   | 1   | -   | \n| 17th  | +6                | -                                                 | 4              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | \n| 18th  | +6                | Timeless Body, Beast Spells                       | 4              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | \n| 19th  | +6                | Ability Score Improvement                         | 4              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 1   | 1   | \n| 20th  | +6                | Archdruid                                         | 4              | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 2   | 1   | 1   | ","spellcasting_ability":"Wisdom","subtypes_name":"Druid Circles","archetypes":[{"name":"Circle of the Land","slug":"circle-of-the-land","desc":"The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites. \n \n##### Bonus Cantrip \n \nWhen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. \n \n##### Natural Recovery \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level \n(rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. \n \nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots. \n \n##### Circle Spells \n \nYour mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the associated list of spells. \n \nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. \n \n**Arctic (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                     | \n|-------------|-----------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | hold person, spike growth         | \n| 5th         | sleet storm, slow                 | \n| 7th         | freedom of movement, ice storm    | \n| 9th         | commune with nature, cone of cold | \n \n**Coast (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                      | \n|-------------|------------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | mirror image, misty step           | \n| 5th         | water breathing, water walk        | \n| 7th         | control water, freedom of movement | \n| 9th         | conjure elemental, scrying         | \n \n**Desert (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                                 | \n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | blur, silence                                 | \n| 5th         | create food and water, protection from energy | \n| 7th         | blight, hallucinatory terrain                 | \n| 9th         | insect plague, wall of stone                  | \n \n**Forest (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                    | \n|-------------|----------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | barkskin, spider climb           | \n| 5th         | call lightning, plant growth     | \n| 7th         | divination, freedom of movement  | \n| 9th         | commune with nature, tree stride | \n \n**Grassland (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                    | \n|-------------|----------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | invisibility, pass without trace | \n| 5th         | daylight, haste                  | \n| 7th         | divination, freedom of movement  | \n| 9th         | dream, insect plague             | \n \n**Mountain (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                   | \n|-------------|---------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | spider climb, spike growth      | \n| 5th         | lightning bolt, meld into stone | \n| 7th         | stone shape, stoneskin          | \n| 9th         | passwall, wall of stone         | \n \n**Swamp (table)** \n \n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                        | \n|-------------|--------------------------------------| \n| 3rd         | acid arrow, darkness                 | \n| 5th         | water walk, stinking cloud           | \n| 7th         | freedom of movement, locate creature | \n| 9th         | insect plague, scrying               | \n \n##### Land's Stride \n \nStarting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. \n \nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* spell. \n \n##### Nature's Ward \n \nWhen you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease. \n \n##### Nature's Sanctuary \n \nWhen you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. \n \nThe creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. \n \n> ### Sacred Plants and Wood \n> \n> A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. \n> \n> Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. \n> \n> Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants. \n \n> ### Druids and the Gods \n> \n> Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.","document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"5e Core Rules","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"},{"name":"Circle of Ash","slug":"circle-of-ash","desc":"Druids of the Circle of Ash believe in the power of rebirth and resurrection, both physical and spiritual. The ash they take as their namesake is the result of burning and death, but it can fertilize the soil and help bring forth new life. For these druids, ash is the ultimate symbol of the elegant cycle of life and death that is the foundation of the natural world. Some such druids even use fresh ash to clean themselves, and the residue is often kept visible on their faces.\n  Druids of this circle often use the phoenix as their symbol, an elemental creature that dies and is reborn from its own ashes. These druids aspire to the same purity and believe resurrection is possible if they are faithful to their beliefs. Others of this circle are drawn to volcanos and find volcanic eruptions and their resulting ash clouds to be auspicious events.\n  All Circle of Ash druids request to be cremated after death, and their ashes are often given over to others of their order. What later happens with these ashes, none outside the circle know.\n\n##### Ash Cloud\nAt 2nd level, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape and, rather than assuming a beast form, create a small, brief volcanic eruption beneath the ground, causing it to spew out an ash cloud. As an action, choose a point within 30 feet of you that you can see. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n  This eruption creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of ash centered on the eruption point. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or have disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws until the start of its next turn. Creatures that don't need to breathe or that are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.\n  You automatically succeed on this saving throw while within the area of your ash cloud, but you don't automatically succeed if you are in another Circle of Ash druid's ash cloud.\n  The cloud lasts for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to dismiss it, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\n\n##### Firesight\nStarting at 2nd level, your vision can't be obscured by ash, fire, smoke, fog, or the cloud created by your Ash Cloud feature, but it can still be obscured by other effects, such as dim light, dense foliage, or rain. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against gas or cloud-based effects, such as from the *cloudkill* or *stinking cloud* spells, a gorgon's petrifying breath, or a kraken's ink cloud.\n#### Covered in Ash\nAt 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see (including yourself) takes damage, you can use your reaction to cover the creature in magical ash, giving it temporary hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The target gains the temporary hit points before it takes the damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n  In addition, while your Ash Cloud feature is active and you are within 30 feet of it, you can use a bonus action to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within the cloud. You can use this teleportation no more than once per minute.\n\n##### Feed the Earth\nAt 10th level, your Ash Cloud feature becomes more potent. Instead of the normal eruption effect, when you first create the ash cloud, each creature within 10 feet of the point you chose must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n  In addition, when a creature enters this more potent ash cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws while it remains within the cloud. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe, but creatures that are immune to poison are immune to this effect.\n  If at least one creature takes damage from the ash cloud's eruption, you can use your reaction to siphon that destructive energy into the rapid growth of vegetation. The area within the cloud becomes difficult terrain that lasts while the cloud remains. You can't cause this growth in an area that can't accommodate natural plant growth, such as the deck of a ship or inside a building.\n  The ash cloud now lasts for 10 minutes, until you use a bonus action to dismiss it, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\n\n##### From the Ashes\nBeginning at 14th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, your body is consumed in a fiery explosion. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the explosion, your body becomes a pile of ashes.\n  At the end of your next turn, you reform from the ashes with all of your equipment and half your maximum hit points. You can choose whether or not you reform prone. If your ashes are moved before you reform, you reform in the space that contains the largest pile of your ashes or in the nearest unoccupied space. After you reform, you suffer one level of exhaustion.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.","document__slug":"toh","document__title":"Tome of Heroes","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"},{"name":"Circle of Bees","slug":"circle-of-bees","desc":"Druids of the Circle of Bees are friends to all stinging insects but focus their attention on honeybees and other pollinating insects. When not adventuring, they tend hives, either created by the insects or by themselves. They tap into the horror inherent in stinging insects to protect their allies or the fields hosting their bee friends.\n\n##### Circle Spells\nYour bond with bees and other stinging beasts grants you knowledge of certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the true strike cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, you gain access to the spells listed for those levels in the Circle of Bees Spells table.\n  Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.\n\n**Circle of Bee Spells**\n| Druid Level  | Spells                             | \n|--------------|------------------------------------| \n| 3rd          | *blur*, *bombardment of stings*    | \n| 5th          | *fly*, *haste*                     | \n| 7th          | *giant insect*, *locate creature*  | \n| 9th          | *insect plague*, *telepathic bond* |\n\n##### Bee Bond\nWhen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Acrobatics or Stealth skill (your choice), and you can speak and understand Bee Dance, a language shared by bees that involves flying in dance-like patterns. Bees refuse to attack you, even with magical coercion.\n  When a beast other than a bee attacks you with a weapon that deals poison damage, such as a giant spider's bite or a scorpion's sting, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or have disadvantage on its attack rolls against you until the start of its next turn.\n\n##### Bee Stinger\nAlso at 2nd level, you can use an action and expend one use of your Wild Shape to grow a bee's stinger, typically growing from your wrist, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with an unarmed strike while this stinger is active, you use Wisdom instead of Strength for the attack, and your unarmed strike deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier + poison damage equal to half your proficiency bonus, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\n  The stinger lasts for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down) or until you use your Wild Shape again.\n  When you reach 6th level in this class, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and the poison damage dealt by your stinger equals your proficiency bonus. In addition, the unarmed strike damage you deal while the stringer is active increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.\n\n##### Bumblebee Rush\nAt 6th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action. When you do so, creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Hive Mind\nAt 10th level, when you cast *telepathic bond*, each creature in the link has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks if at least one creature in the link has proficiency in a skill that applies to that check. In addition, if one creature in the link succeeds on a Wisdom (Perception) check to notice a hidden creature or on a Wisdom (Insight) check, each creature in the link also succeeds on the check. Finally, when a linked creature makes an attack, it has advantage on the attack roll if another linked creature that can see it uses a reaction to assist it.\n\n##### Mantle of Bees\nAt 14th level, you can use an action to cover yourself in bees for 1 hour or until you dismiss them (no action required). While you are covered in a mantle of bees, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee weapon, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the attacker takes 1d8 piercing damage and 1d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the attacker takes half the damage and isn't poisoned.\n  While the mantle is active, you can use an action to direct the bees to swarm a 10-foot-radius sphere within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 4d6 piercing damage and 4d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. The bees then disperse, and your mantle ends.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to create the mantle again.","document__slug":"toh","document__title":"Tome of Heroes","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"},{"name":"Circle of Crystals","slug":"circle-of-crystals","desc":"Circle of Crystals druids first arose in subterranean environments, where they helped tend giant crystal gardens, but now they can be found most anywhere with access to underground caverns or geothermal activity. These druids view crystals as a naturally occurring form of order and perfection, and they value the crystals' slow growth cycle, as it reminds them the natural world moves gradually but eternally. This teaches young druids patience and assures elder druids their legacy will be carried on in each spire of crystal. As druids of this circle tend their crystals, they learn how to use the harmonic frequencies of different crystals to create a variety of effects, including storing magic.\n\n##### Resonant Crystal\nWhen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn to create a special crystal that can take on different harmonic frequencies and properties. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. As a bonus action, you can cause the crystal to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the light as a bonus action.\n  Whenever you finish a long rest, you can attune your crystal to one of the following harmonic frequencies. The crystal can have only one harmonic frequency at a time, and you gain the listed benefit while you are wearing or carrying the crystal. The crystal retains the chosen frequency until you finish a long rest. \n* **Clarity.** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. \n* **Cleansing.** You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage. \n* **Focus.** You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain concentration on a spell when you take damage. \n* **Healing.** When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. \n* **Vitality.** Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher using the resonant crystal as your focus, one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you gains temporary hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The temporary hit points last for 1 minute.\nTo create or replace a lost resonant crystal, you must perform a 1-hour ceremony. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous crystal, if one existed. If a previous crystal had a harmonic frequency, the new crystal has that frequency, unless you create the new crystal during a long rest.\n\n##### Crystalline Skin\nStarting at 6th level, when you take damage, you can use a reaction to cause your skin to become crystalline until the end of your next turn. While your skin is crystalline, you have resistance to cold damage, radiant damage and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, including to the triggering damage if it is of the appropriate type. You choose the exact color and appearance of the crystalline skin.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Magical Resonance\nAt 10th level, you can draw on stored magical energy in your resonant crystal to restore some of your spent magic. While wearing or carrying the crystal, you can use a bonus action to recover one expended spell slot of 3rd level or lower. If you do so, you can't benefit from the resonant crystal's harmonic frequency for 1 minute.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Crystalline Form\nAt 14th level, as a bonus action while wearing or carrying your resonant crystal, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to assume a crystalline form instead of transforming into a beast. You gain the following benefits while in this form: \n* You have resistance to cold damage, radiant damage, and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. \n* You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. \n* Your resonant crystal pulses with power, providing you with the benefits of all five harmonic frequencies. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose to activate only the Healing or Vitality harmonic frequencies or both. If you activate both, you can choose two different targets or the same target.\nThis feature lasts 1 minute, or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.","document__slug":"toh","document__title":"Tome of Heroes","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"},{"name":"Circle of Sand","slug":"circle-of-sand","desc":"The Circle of Sand originally arose among the desert dunes, where druids forged an intimate connection with the sands that surrounded them. Now such circles gather anywhere with excess sand, including coastlines or badlands.\n  While the unacquainted might view sand as lifeless and desolate, druids of this circle know the truth—there is life within the sand, as there is almost anywhere. These druids have witnessed the destructive power of sand and the sandstorm and know to fear and respect them. Underestimating the power of sand is only for the foolish.\n\n##### Sand Form\nWhen you join this circle at 2nd level, you learn to adopt a sandy form. You can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Wild Shape feature and transform yourself into a form made of animated sand rather than transforming into a beast form. While in your sand form, you retain your game statistics. Because your body is mostly sand, you can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing, and you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to escape a grapple or the restrained condition.\n\nYou choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the equipment to move with you if you flow through particularly narrow spaces.\n\nYou can stay in your sand form for 10 minutes, or until you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again. While in your sand form, you can use a bonus action to do one of the following: \n* **Abrasive Blast.** You launch a blast of abrasive sand at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the creature takes slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier. \n* **Stinging Cloud.** You emit a cloud of fine sand at a creature you can see within 5 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded until the end of its next turn.\n\nWhen you reach 10th level in this class, you can stay in your sand form for 1 hour or until you dismiss it. In addition, the damage of Abrasive Blast increases to 2d8, and the range of Stinging Cloud increases to 10 feet.\n\n##### Diffuse Form\nAlso at 2nd level, when you are hit by a weapon attack while in your Sand Form, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Sand Dervish\nStarting at 6th level, you can use a bonus action to create a sand dervish in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. The sand dervish is a cylinder of whirling sand that is 10 feet tall and 5 feet wide. A creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sand dervish must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 slashing damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the dervish. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.\n  As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the sand dervish up to 30 feet in any direction. If you ram the dervish into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the dervish's damage, and the dervish stops moving this turn. When you move the dervish, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and float it across pits up to 10 feet wide.\nThe sand dervish lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\nWhen you reach 10th level in this class, the damage dealt by the dervish increases to 2d8.\n\n##### Echo of the Dunes\nAt 10th level, your connection with sand deepens, and you can call on the power of the deep dunes to do one of the following: \n* **Sand Sphere.** You can use an action to conjure a 20-foot radius sphere of thick, swirling sand at a point you can see within 90 feet. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. A creature moving through the area must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. The sphere lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). \n* **Whirlwind.** You can use an action to transform into a whirlwind of sand until the start of your next turn. While in this form, your movement speed is doubled, and your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While in whirlwind form, you have resistance to all damage, and you can't be grappled, petrified, knocked prone, restrained, or stunned, but you also can't cast spells, can't make attacks, and can't manipulate objects that require fine dexterity.\nOnce you use one of these options, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Sandstorm\nAt 14th level, you can use an action to create a sandstorm of swirling wind and stinging sand. The storm rages in a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 30-foot radius centered on a point you can see within 120 feet. The storm spreads around corners, its area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused. The buffeting winds and sand make the area difficult terrain. The storm lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.\n  When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d8 slashing damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.\n  You are immune to the effects of the storm, and you can extend that immunity to a number of creatures that you can see within 120 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.","document__slug":"toh","document__title":"Tome of Heroes","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"},{"name":"Circle of the Green","slug":"circle-of-the-green","desc":"Druids of the Circle of the Green devote themselves to the plants and green things of the world, recognizing the role of plants in giving life. By continued communion with plant life, they believe they draw nearer to what they call “The Green,” a cosmic thread that binds all plant life. Druids of this circle believe they gain their abilities by tapping into the Green, and they use this connection to summon a spirit from it.\n\n##### Circle Spells\nWhen you join this circle at 2nd level, you form a bond with a plant spirit, a creature of the Green. Your link with this spirit grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of the Green Spells table.\n  Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.\n\n**Circle of the Green Spells**\n| Druid Level  | Spells                               | \n|--------------|--------------------------------------| \n| 2nd          | *entangle*, *goodberry*              | \n| 3rd          | *barkskin*, *spike growth*           | \n| 5th          | *speak with plants*, *vine carpet*   | \n| 7th          | *dreamwine*, *hallucinatory terrain* | \n| 9th          | *enchanted bloom*, *tree stride*     |\n\n##### Summon Green Spirit\nStarting at 2nd level, you can summon a spirit of the Green, a manifestation of primordial plant life. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon the Green spirit rather than assuming a beast form.\n  The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. When the spirit appears, the area in a 10-foot radius around it becomes tangled with vines and other plant growth, becoming difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.\n  The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Green Spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.\n  You determine the spirit's appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches and leaves, while others look like creatures with leafy bodies and heads made of gourds or fruit. Some even resemble beasts, only made entirely of plant material.\n  In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The green spirit can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.\n  The spirit remains for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die. When it manifests, the spirit bears 10 fruit that are infused with magic. Each fruit works like a berry created by the *goodberry* spell.\n\n##### Gift of the Green\nAt 6th level, the bond with your green spirit enhances your restorative spells and gives you the power to cast additional spells. Once before the spirit's duration ends, you can cast one of the following spells without expending a spell slot or material components: *locate animals or plants*, *pass without trace* (only in environments with ample plant life), *plant growth*, or *speak with plants*. You can't cast a spell this way again until the next time you summon your green spirit.\n  Whenever you cast a spell that restores hit points while your green spirit is summoned, roll a d8 and add the result to the total hit points restored.\n  In addition, when you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your green spirit.\n\n##### Verdant Interference\nStarting at 10th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you or your green spirit is attacked, you can use your reaction to cause vines and vegetation to burst from the ground and grasp at the attacker, giving the attacker disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Spirit Symbiosis\nAt 14th level, while your green spirit is within 30 feet of you, you can use an action to join with it, letting its plant matter grow around you. While so joined, you gain the following benefits: \n* You gain temporary hit points equal to your green spirit's current hit points. \n* You gain a climbing speed of 30 feet. \n* You have advantage on Constitution saving throws. \n* The ground within 10 feet of you is difficult terrain for creatures hostile to you. \n* You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to make a tendril attack against one creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. Make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d8 + your Wisdom modifier.\nThis feature lasts until the temporary hit points you gained from this feature are reduced to 0, until the spirit's duration ends, or until you use an action to separate. If you separate, the green spirit has as many hit points as you had temporary hit points remaining. If this effect ends because your temporary hit points are reduced to 0, the green spirit disappears until you summon it again.","document__slug":"toh","document__title":"Tome of Heroes","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"},{"name":"Circle of the Shapeless","slug":"circle-of-the-shapeless","desc":"Druids of the Circle of the Shapeless believe that oozes, puddings, and jellies serve an important and integral role in the natural world, particularly in decomposition and in clearing detritus.

At 2nd level, you learn the *acid splash* cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Shapeless Spells table.

You can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to take on an ooze-like form rather than transforming into a beast.\n  While in your ooze form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes less substantial and appears wet and slimy. Your skin may change in color and appearance, resembling other forms of ooze like black pudding, ochre jelly, gray ooze, or even translucent, like a gelatinous cube.\n  You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the equipment to move with you if you flow through particularly narrow spaces.\n  Your ooze form lasts for 10 minutes or until you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.\nWhile in ooze form, you gain the following benefits: \n* **Acid Weapons.** Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 acid damage on a hit. \n* **Amorphous.** You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. \n* **Climber.** You have a climbing speed of 20 feet. \n* **Oozing Form.** When a creature touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 acid damage to that creature.\n\n##### Slimy Pseudopod\nAt 6th level, you can use a bonus action to cause an oozing pseudopod to erupt from your body for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. On the turn you activate this feature, and as a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns, you can make a melee spell attack with the pseudopod against a creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 acid damage.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you reach 10th level in this class, the acid damage dealt by your pseudopod increases to 2d6.\n\n##### Improved Ooze Form\nAt 10th level, your ooze form becomes more powerful. It now lasts 1 hour, and the acid damage dealt by your Acid Weapons and Oozing Form increases to 2d6.\n\n##### Engulfing Embrace\nAt 14th level, while in your ooze form, you can use an action to move into the space of a creature within 5 feet of you that is your size or smaller and try to engulf it. The target creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.\n  On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet away from you or to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.\n  On a failed save, you enter the creature's space, and the creature takes 2d6 acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature is restrained and has total cover against attacks and other effects outside of your body. The engulfed creature takes 4d6 acid damage at the start of each of your subsequent turns. When you move, the engulfed creature moves with you.\n  An engulfed creature can attempt to escape by taking an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of you.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to try to engulf another creature.","document__slug":"toh","document__title":"Tome of Heroes","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"},{"name":"Circle of Wind","slug":"circle-of-wind","desc":"Founded in deserts, badlands, and grasslands, where wind dominates and controls the landscape, the teachings of the Circle of Wind have spread far and wide, like a mighty storm.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Hunger of Storm's Fury\nBeginning at 14th level, when you succeed on a saving throw against a spell or effect that deals lightning damage, you take no damage and instead regain a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.
